5 July 2019,One of the best films of this decade,I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4978432/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,"You name a genre, this movie covers it",I can t remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as Parasite The movie starts out almost like an Ocean s Eleven heist film and then expands into a comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime and even horror film It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too I love a film that respects its audience There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch ability factor will be very high The film was incredibly entertaining too I can t think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening at least in terms of action Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this I had a great time with Parasite and I think most that give it a chance will too,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5166061/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,In a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination Anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky Cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous It s easy to be nice when you re rich the mother in this film Jang Hye jin at one point observes But it s a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes they ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down either by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder But in a meritocracy you can t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it No you must blame yourself You should have tread more carefully You should have climbed more quickly You should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap If you fail in a meritocracy it s all your fault You should have tried harder Better luck next time Kim Ki woo Choi Woo sik the young man who is the main character of PARASITE several times refers to metaphors and the film itself is of course a metaphor On a surface level viewers are treated to a very thrilling engaging well paced and well plotted crime story At all times however bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film there are deeply personal meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer These insights are rarely foregrounded They are so subtly interwoven in fact that if you re like me you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate humanist story you ve just witnessed Bong Joon ho s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he s done so I want to avoid spoilers here but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece beautifully lensed enthrallingly edited superbly acted and intimately involving South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky Higher education is widespread so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs I lived in Korea once and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day six days a week public school English immersion private school piano class soccer team taekwondo math camp chess club and so on I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long As the father Song Kang ho in the film at one point says this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job One can t afford not to struggle The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea however They are the story of global capitalism and the specter of American materialism and imperialism note the Indians looms heavily over the film Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all It s nice to dream and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine and how nice an ending it is when they do But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be maybe just whims and fancy More often it seems our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5080349/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it",A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family if they can engineer it they can each get one of the jobs within the household This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story seeing the rich family as the marks As it plays out though it keeps this assumption in the background eating at the viewer as an idea before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot Between the start and then the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself In this the film engages and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film for me the key one was the falseness of the con itself Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family it is not like they are stealing money from them or somehow dislodging them from their position in life no they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job and the rich family could probably not care less about the truth as long as their needs continue to be met This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film and adds sense to what happens and why but it is interesting in and of itself Technically the film looks great and the director builds mood and tone well Performances are strong across all the cast but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition but it is a handsome clever film and the timing in the year is right I don t see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture but this is more to do with the system than with the film Regardless of awards or not it is an engaging drama with unusual developments and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative,0.0,20.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6001308/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,It s not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didn t like the second half of it It s much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end I m not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values But still I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there s a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to So I think it s no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences Some complained that they don t understand Ki Taek s motive for killing Mr Park But to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the line It s a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people s privacy or as one should mind one s own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position If interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellings It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon Ho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a danger Instead he chose to make Mr Park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature He seems to treat Ki Taek fairly enough at first but he also warns the latter not to cross the line if Ki Taek attempts to pry into his private life At first it seems that it s quite easy for Ki Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr Park s house in various roles and mingle with them Ki Taek even compliments how nice Mr Park s family is but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard when he was hiding under the table what Mr Park really thinks of him almost a different species of the human being who doesn t even smell like him Ki Taek s final disillusionment came when Mr Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son s shock while virtually ignoring Ki Taek s daughter s status who s dying on the ground spurting blood from the stab wound That moment Ki Taek realizes how Mr Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being but something much more insignificant And he also realizes the line that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour Instead it is a line that can even determine the life of those lesser human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those proper human beings However easy it was for Ki Taek s family to sneak into Mr Park s house or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr Park s family their existence is no better than that of a parasite which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house With such disillusionment and anger Ki Taek chose to kill Mr Park as a parasite could to its host and like a parasite he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host s body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr Park s or Ki Taek s personalities Instead it s a line drawn by an invisible hand separating those classes according to their respective social conditions which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey Of course not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care free pastime that everyone can understand But without if the movie didn t change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year 4 665 out of 5 128 found this helpful,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5195256/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,Thoroughly entertaining,PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho a talent I ve long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago He s had his ups and downs over the years although they ve generally been ups rather than downs but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece It s a quiet and reflective work his maturist yet a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way The issue is universal which is why this film did so well abroad and at the Oscars although I ve been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think,10.0,70.0,98.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6225768/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2020,An original dark comedy about class struggles,This is a well written and well perfomed original film With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success,9.0,193.0,277.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5400852/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,When the buddy who got into college tells him he s moving to the US and he s passing on the 14 year old he s been tutoring just tell em you re enrolled in college even though you aren t the son of a family so low class they ve sunk through the foundation finds them very nice very accepting and very clueless So he and his layabout family get all the help fired his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister the father as the new chauffeur and the mother as the cook housekeeper Yet even though you don t see them there are vermin living in the foundations and they come out when the people in charge aren t around It s a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror with a script that handles the theme of the people we don t see because they re not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion When I saw it in a theater during its New York run I was impressed I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie and might even win,10.0,38.0,58.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7628856/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea like what movie Us attempts to do but done properly It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like and its realism is very painful Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc but many people still live miserable lives and situation is very similar to that in China where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the America with a few cruel but precise strokes The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie,9.0,88.0,135.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5411971/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,A black comedy on social inequality,There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim Parasite 2019 generates a great deal of conversation but be warned it is not a film for everyone especially those averse to gory endings If you step back from the story s twists and turns the narrative premise is simple A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as one by one each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor driver and housekeeper The gullible family is easy to deceive while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion However the plan comes un stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub plots and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens But that is not the point of the film Director Joon ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea s social order This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy There is more to this film than political discourse As a black comedy it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low hanging fruit One can also find elements of magical fantasy as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers The acting tends towards wooden and it is difficult to warm to any particular character The film s climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites For many the critical pendulum swings towards the masterpiece label But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original engaging and disturbing tale of endemic class tension oppression and helplessness Although tenuous the message has universal relevance,8.0,118.0,190.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5362817/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,As a film about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us tell a multi layered story in a widely entertaining manner but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative That s not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare writer director Bong Joon ho is in a class of his own The film follows a lower class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper class family and their lavish household As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances It s a twisty satire on social economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts However to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride,9.0,362.0,566.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4972695/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,Finally saw this much talked about film As a fan of Korean thrillers this film surpassed my expectations The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals The film begins like a dark satire it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u it is not at all demeaning It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious,10.0,102.0,183.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5459301/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2019,"FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD",This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families one very poor the other very rich How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half then in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread and perhaps even enjoy Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes If you see only one foreign language film this year this should be it Exciting and provocative throughout it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away Deserves all the accolades it has already and surely will continue to receive,10.0,212.0,357.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5234889/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,"""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""",This film s ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly Usually when a hot new release makes it s way into the Top 250 it manages to remain in it s general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote Parasite entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall and since then has managed to improve it s position to 26 as I write this No one knows if that will hold obviously so I m curious to see how the movie rates over time Having stated that I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it s way into the life and home of the Park family What was questionable to me was why the Kim s weren t able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min Seo joon Park suggested the tutoring job to Ki woo Woo sik Choi Each of the Kim s demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long It s not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition because once that ambition kicked into gear there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park s Not that it wasn t done by underhanded or devious means but with those kinds of street smarts they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood But that was the set up so you have to go with it Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim s luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak Personally I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon gwang Jeong eun Lee unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home they would have been discovered by the Kim s had they followed and observed Moon gwang to begin with Instead the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim s from their lucrative positions I have to admit I was somewhat baffled by Mr Kim s Kang ho Song stabbing of Park Dong ik Sun kyun Lee but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective I can t say that I agree wholeheartedly but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive all revolving around the idea of crossing the line that the Kim s were guilty of Even so by giving the story a Tarantino esque spin for it s denouement was going more than a bit over the top And to venture even further into the realm of unreality Ki woo s survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone not once but twice was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer As for the ultimate finale who s to say that Kim woo s plan to rescue his dad wasn t a viable one grow up get rich and buy the house Good luck with that idea because in the very words of Mr Kim himself If you make a plan life never works out that way And on top of that it would be a decade long mission at the very least In the final analysis if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park s I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home But it didn t turn out that way and as a result I think it misses the mark as the year s Best Picture at the Oscars Addendum 2 10 2020 Well I m not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture s chances at the Oscars It won Best Picture last night in a pretty competitive field Congratulations,8.0,43.0,75.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438540/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong",This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d Or at the Cannes Festival If I have one and only one advice to give you go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information Indeed this film might schematically be split in two parts the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush As a postscript an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you re French in the middle of the film the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap Le rustique and Bresse bleu Unbelievable,9.0,208.0,385.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4924389/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.",A family who doesn t have a lot of money or opportunities in life starts working for a wealthy family But will this change the life of the poor family DIRECTOR Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS Bong Joon Ho Han Jin Wan CAST Song Kang Ho Lee Sun Kyun Cho Yeo Jeong Choi Woo Shik Park So Dam Lee Jung Eun Chang Hyae Jin In the movie we follow the Kim family who doesn t have much money By chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family He teaches their daughter English Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house Then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie The title of the movie turns things on its head Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience Parasites are found in all classes of society From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and it s pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like they re on board the Titanic They must run from the top and down to the engine room What a wonderful sequence and it s so beautiful to watch The cast was fantastic and everyone fit the needs of their roles The characters were well written with the performances complementing that perfectly It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people whom despite their eccentricities maintained a grounded realistic feel The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing So if you like foreign films thrillers or movies that can make you think a little check this one out It s a crisp film from a technical aspect and with a blend of great writing and acting you can t go wrong It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence 9 10,9.0,21.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5469880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,Lacks any realistic human dimension,South Korean director Bong Joon ho Okja says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way Palme d Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival Bong s Parasite Gisaengchung does indeed thwart expectations but the question is to what end Defying any strict genre classification the film is a conglomeration of comedy drama satire crime horror and anything else you can throw into the mix Bong sees the film as a statement about the ranks and classes inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye and says that the film depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today s increasingly polarized society Unfortunately the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong s statement without much impact The film looks at class differences between two families one well to do and the other n eer do well For the Kim family life is a struggle They live in a cramped bug infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf The father Ki taek Song Kang ho Snowpiercer has failed in business and has accumulated many debts His son and daughter Ki woo Choi Woo sik Train to Busan and Ki jung Park So dam Cinderella and Four Knights TV series have repeatedly failed college entrance exams The mother Chung sook Hyae jin Jang Adulthood along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company but cannot even get that right Not to worry they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi Fi from the next door coffee shop On the other hand the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages Mr Park Lee Sun kyun Jo Pil ho The Dawning Rage is the CEO of a high tech company and the family lives in a spacious modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong The Target a teenage daughter Da hye Jung Ji so The Tiger and a hyper active young son Da song Jung Hyun jun Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude for Bong they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters With the aid of a friend Ki woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da hye Of course he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs Park of his competence With that conquest out of the way the cunning Ki woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso Mrs Park hires Ki jung as an art teacher then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims this time for the deadbeat dad Ki taek and his wife Chung sook Bong said that Sometimes with the characters in my films I look at them cynically but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters even with the villains This compassion however does not seem to extend to the loyal hardworking household workers their work scammed out of existence Without going into detail the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over the top unsettling even though utterly implausible Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers revenge bloody violence a torrential rainstorm people hiding under beds and any other mayhem that may come to mind To be clear Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp edged yet it is hardly as one critic described it a masterful dissection of social inequality When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film Bong said I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about It is in parts funny frightening and sad and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it I ll wish for nothing more Enjoy the drink In a little while you may have trouble remembering what the film was about,7.0,72.0,133.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5189278/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,"Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable",I think there s a really good movie buried in Parasite somewhere but I gave up trying to find it It has the same problem the director s previous The Host had the pacing is broken That s not all though People have written about the movie s unexpected twists and turns The thing is it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive they are too few and far between and too unbelievable The first major twist happens about an hour in and seems to come out of nowhere The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits though they are far fetched how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly until by the end I wasn t even paying attention Pity Some of the sequences were brilliant,6.0,78.0,146.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5338090/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,It's so metaphorical,It s so metaphorical is what Kevin says when they show him Da Song s paint he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about most critics of this movie say exactly that It s so metaphorical obviously Most know what you are talking about when writing something about a movie I have to be 100 sure that I have understood It s so metaphorical This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground sometimes leaves it to the public s interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house the house is shown in a low angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way as there are many examples throughout the film the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight the shots in the Kim s house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs are some simply steps over others Who are the real Parasites the Kims or the Parks the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty living under the ground and in precarious conditions but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings there is nothing they can do their children are educated by others their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others Kim s family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages even better than many college students his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did control and support Da Song but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won t be able to read while he has a dream after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes,9.0,120.0,191.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5446179/?ref_=tt_urv
