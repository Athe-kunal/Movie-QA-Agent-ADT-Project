       "   'review': 'Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men For such a simplistic story set in one jury room it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense mystery and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty only one jury man Henry Fonda doesn t put his hand up Trial and Character revelations doubts and possibilities follow So masterfully crafted is this film that every time I watch it only gets better It includes some of the best character development I ve ever seen Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history one of the most important contributions to world cinema However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb who really made this film legendary with their incredibly realistic performances Casting was genius And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful Black and White made the film all the more powerful And the music was minimal which gave the film a more atmospheric experience like you were their in the jury room with them and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds This inexpensive film with such a simple setting had the world talking the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film Lawrence Of Arabia and It s A Wonderful Life are other ones that come to mind This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film It sums up everything I love about film Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story it s platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time bar none A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet s honor Is it possible Juror 8 Henry Fonda',\n",

       "   'review': 'This film is superb in fact as Shakespeare once said Its the bees knees The film captivates the audience from the beginning Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves The characters are well draw out and individual each with his own personality The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start We imagine that the case is open and shut 11 me saying guilty and 1 not We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda s character is correct in saying that he doubts Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight joining his side as members of the jury do On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances Fonda Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day How a film should be made Modern directors take note thats ur telling off for the day 10 10',\n",

       "   'review': 'Juror 1 the foreman Martin Balsam football coach Well I won t be too technical or make a long speech it s just that it s a one set film so it s new and risky because you know dialogs are not enough we need uh the thrills and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively it s like the jury room becomes smaller and the faces bigger I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere And what an explosive climax I could hardly breathe I know it s strange but the direction well the movie is one hell of a thriller I well my verdict is clear GREAT MOVIE Juror 2 John Fiedler bank clerk I don t know It s an excellent film served by great performances Every character was convincing so were their interactions I can t find any flaw for me there s nothing to add and nothing to remove It is a GREAT MOVIE Juror 3 Lee J Cobb businessman I told you why this movie is great it s just thought provoking everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good hearted hero and simple minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive But this is an intelligent film which even at the end makes you question if the kid is guilty or not Because it has nothing to do with punishment it s about justice without any prejudice and that deserves respect yes sir No doubt for me GREAT MOVIE Juror 4 E G Marshall stockbroker First of all it s an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors Secondly the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add respectful of the viewer s intelligence The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses a credit to Sidney Lumet Last but not least it s about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence 12 Angry Men delivers a brilliant intelligent and universally inspiring message To conclude I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE Juror 5 Jack Klugman the man from the slum What else to say I second the idea that it s a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance My verdict is GREAT MOVIE Juror 6 Edward Binns painter A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect These are movies with no special effects no big star cast no big explosions no flashy cars and no sexy girls You have a honest simple movie featuring ordinary men but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover regardless of his or her age Anyway GREAT MOVIE Juror 7 Jack Warden salesman Come on everyone is using big words and noble concepts but for me this movie is just damn entertaining Hey admit it the dialogs the way opposite characters interact create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch sometimes well I think you can say anything but without entertainment a film is worthless and the movie could ve been a bore just all talk and no walk but it wasn t it worked for me GREAT MOVIE Juror 8 Henry Fonda architect This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments Justice is done by men blindly and implacably this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt and when you have what appears to be an open and shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject well this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts our words our acts 12 Angry Men is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice GREAT MOVIE Juror 9 Joseph Sweeney retired This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality It s an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted While watching 12 Angry Men I understood that a consensus when rapidly built means that the truth must be elsewhere And one truth for sure this is a GREAT MOVIE Juror 10 Ed Begley garage owner I hate the patronizing way some left wing good hearted people adore this film this has nothing to do with politics truth or justice it s about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button you missed the point and that s the beauty of the film you re all easily fooled Not for the reasons you think but it s a GREAT MOVIE Juror 11 Joseph Voskovek watchmaker No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film it s about our deepest convictions It s about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance GREAT MOVIE Juror 12 Robert Webber advertising executive Wow what I can say it s not an exact science you know you can find a reason A to appreciate it a reason B or C let s just say that the sigma of these reasons explains why it s an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said why 12 Angry Men is a GREAT MOVIE',\n",

       "   'review': 'Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18 year old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a guilty verdict with Juror 3 Lee J Cobb the loudest supporter one juror Juror 8 Henry Fonda stands as the lone Not Guilty verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts witnesses and evidence 12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay the movie was a box office disappointment in the US but did better internationally due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn t be until television airings the film would find an audience 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references allusions and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re adaptations both domestically and abroad Rightly so because while 12 Angry Men s premise is very simple it s filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime The movie is essentially a chamber piece Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie once we re in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E G Marshall Martin Baslam and John Fiedler just to name a few we don t leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence 12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes Henry Fonda gives a great performance but it wouldn t stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of It s a classic for a reason',\n",

       "   'review': 'Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument reason and logic Starring Henry Fonda as Juror 8 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first degree murder On the surface the case seems open and shut with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution s case Only one dissenter remains and that is Henry Fonda s Juror 8 Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent just that he doesn t know and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt 12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance but it has many more strings to its bow than just this Indeed above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable Initially it may seem that Fonda s Juror is simply playing devil s advocate but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you The more you scrutinise so called unshakable evidence the more you find holes in it and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers Obviously Juror 8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda and pre conceived notions of what truth equals but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws The whole movie s pace is absolutely perfect and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary with sharp imagery and clever camera work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life To detail the jurors themselves Juror 1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman He appears to lack esteem and the chance to boss the table by being the leader perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case He does not want to be useless so is forced to take charge Juror 2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon never deviating so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status He does not really have much to say about the case taking it at face value Juror 3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is open and shut As time goes on and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier But he refuses to cave Juror 4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of that kind of person extremely personally Experiences inner conflict between head and heart Juror 5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself Emerges more as the deliberations wear on he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty and systematically sets about conveying this to the others Juror 6 is the common working man with very little input and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion Juror 7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case Doesn t want to be there and while he details a little about the boy s background to start off with his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible with no care about the wheels of justice Juror 8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him and wishes to explore it He meets much opposition Juror 9 is a wise wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths Juror 10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts A vile and odious creature he has no interest in people like that roaming the streets and is offended at having to live in the same city as them Juror 11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion His European accent draws derision from some others as does his general nationality but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments rarely saying anything which lacks thought Juror 12 is a good natured man but not a terribly strong thinker He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case often following others and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job Overall 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get Incredible script amazing performances and captivating direction Highly recommended',\n",

       "   'review': 'Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera work removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines What we are left with is cinema in its purest form where acting is the sole driving force of the narrative and our attention is retained through the director s thorough exploitation of a bare bones scenario Sidney Lumet s debut feature length film 12 Angry Men 1957 is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues With the exception of its bookends and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling increasingly claustrophobic jury room as a group of twelve jurors all male mostly middle aged and middle class with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father Prior to 1957 director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television though it wasn t until he released his first feature film a low budget offering shot in only 17 days that he began to attract the attention of critics Though 12 Angry Men was commercially unsuccessful in an age of lavish technicolour adventures David Lean s magnificent The Bridge on the River Kwai 1957 was more to the taste of audiences of the day the film received three Oscar nominations for Best Writing Best Director and Best Picture Of course it was Lean s epic that won each of these categories among numerous others Lumet s film adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing as the apparently bored judge Rudy Bond offers his final instructions to the jury members the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy handed narration What ultimately makes 12 Angry Men such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors each player delivering a distinct perfectly pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury s deliberations on the court case Central to the story of course is Juror 8 Henry Fonda the lone dissenting member whose unwillingness to send a conceivably innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an open and shut case Fonda who also co produced the film gives a sincere and righteous performance his actions assuredly heroic despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice The remaining players in clock wise order around the juror s table Martin Balsam John Fiedler Lee J Cobb E G Marshall Jack Klugman Ed Binns Jack Warden Joseph Sweeney Ed Begley George Voskovec and Robert Webber each contribute with faultless performances though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others It would be plain na ve to label any one of the twelve jurors a villain but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda s well meaning dissenter is Juror 3 Lee J Cobb a loud mouthed and temperamental bully whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence Juror 3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man Equally bigoted is Juror 10 Ed Begley whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower class citizens In one of the film s most brutally powerful sequences the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror 10 s deplorable outburst his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow minded views Also interesting is Jack Warden s Juror 7 an impatient salesman whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority Despite working in an extremely confined space Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting and cinematographer Boris Kaufman who also worked on On the Waterfront 1954 employed lenses with gradually increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters heightening the ever present sense of claustrophobia Lumet is a master of creating mood as he also demonstrated in his finest film Fail Safe 1964 and there s a certain illogical urgency in the jurors proceedings as though Fonda s character is continually fighting a losing battle Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed Juror 8 s extra investigations purchasing the knife pacing the old witness journey to the door would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single all too significant moral according to the Constitution the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt Ultimately whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point particularly when the life of a potentially innocent man is hanging in the balance',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men 1957 What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling It isn t the built in civics lesson even though it does make you glad for the jury system Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime there is a plot about human nature The men are all etched just enough to become types not stereotypes in a bad sense miraculously but kinds of people we recognize And with amazing economy the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies become the guts of this play of passion It doesn t hurt that the editing is supremely crisp the continuity is spot on and the casting is brilliant if color blind see below It also doesn t hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman see On the Waterfront is that really clear dramatic black and white photography of post noir 1950s It s beautiful and startling showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet and at other times close ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room In other words this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece cast and crew top to bottom As viewers it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario We might see ourselves or our friends in these people but even if they are strangers if they seem a full half century away from our own types they are still people we are curious about Sitting on a jury being locked together in a room and having to decide about the execution of the accused all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly There is not getting around deciding both on the verdict of course but also on what kind of men are in the room Why are they voting one way or the other What makes them stubborn or wise or clever Or funny annoying selfish The all white male jury is potentially a problem It should have been a problem back then when planning the movie and it becomes one now because the movie represents history whether or not it likes it After the Civil War by amending the Constitution and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875 it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries and this was tested in court many times often in the South New York City could easily end up with an all white jury and downtown Manhattan it isn t unlikely but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room Likewise with women who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries In the 1950s white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors such as voting lists so again an all male white jury isn t so unlikely just conspicuous Having said all that I think the movie works partly because on some simple level the jurors are all the same To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other Having one guy be from a slum and know about knives is revealed slowly and we can t really outwardly distinguish that man from any other Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated So 12 Angry Men isn t an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise but a study in types and countertypes reactions and resistance to action Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t v and when he ventured into movies this was his first success he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium back then especially He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail Safe another politically charged drama in black and white and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room And later in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057 just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant the way 1909 does to us from here Already as much as this is a fabulous inspiring vivid movie it is also showing its seams its contrivance and its agenda too clearly For now it s a concise dramatic masterpiece',\n",

       "   'title': \"One of Cinema's Best Courtroom Dramas!\",\n",
       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema Even though it is an older film it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas On the surface this film is a pure drama about the courtroom but it goes much much deeper than that I was discussing in an earlier review Dial M for Murder about the use of a single location Well this film inhabits that single location very much so and the film is actually famous for that Outside of three minutes the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length s shots allow the audience to feel more of each character s feelings Lumet later discussed how a lens plot occurred to him As the movie progressed he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters A very good technique I must point out Another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don t know much about the case only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on All we know is that a Spanish American boy is accused of murdering his father Other than a very bored looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors In most courtroom movies it s clear they like to come to a final verdict This movie is very different because we don t know whether the boy is guilty or not although we can assume based off the events of the movie The movie is all about reasonable evidence a very important study in criminal justice Through the evidence depicted in the case did the boy commit the murder or not In the first few minutes in the jury room it s clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty However there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision The problem is that one juror Juror 8 believes the boy is not guilty This is where all the fun begins The film is based on emotion logic and even prejudice to describe what is going on This particular juror does not sway from his opinion even though the other jurors are growing more angry more restless But as Juror 8 Henry Fonda describes why he believes the boy is not guilty and he presents an admirable case why people begin to agree with 8 There are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons For example Juror 10 Ed Begley is an extreme racist as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie Then there is Juror 3 Lee J Cobb who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with 8 Then there is Juror 4 E G Marshall a man with wire rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic I think it was a wise movie not to give the character names It makes each character much more powerful I could actually remember the juror by their numbers That s a testament for how great and unique each character is In the 95 minutes the film runs we become invested in each character very much so Whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right we truly sympathize with them all That is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast It s interesting because there was only one bankable star here at the time and that was Henry Fonda who played Juror 8 very well He presented his case as believable as he can be The rest of the cast were some of the best actors of New York City at the time such as Lee J Cobb Martin Balsam Jack Warden Ed Begley Joseph Sweeney Jack Klugman E G Marshall John Fiedler Edward Binns Robert Webber and George Voskovec They all perform very well in their roles They need to be angry and they certainly did get angry Sidney Lumet is one of the best and influential American directors of all time This was is first feature film and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene In each film he does he always has something to say usually something controversial Not so much in this film but in subsequent films He does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people and cause them to think and act irrationally As some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out 12 Angry Men based off a television play ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made It came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty Despite the critical acclaim of this film the movie actually wasn t a box office hit when it originally opened But enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is It spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful influential film My Grade A',\n",

       "   'review': 'I love this film and watch it whenever it s on It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father These men are a cross section of American and in particular New York society circa 1957 and range from the working to the upper middle classes from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude and from those who think they re smart and perceptive and often are not to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly The play is so intensely written and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they re deliberating At the start of the film there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness in the guilt of defendant It s the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position which is one of reasonable doubt It s here that Mr Rose or rather his lead character plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence as has been pointed out over the years and while I m generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with especially where medicine and science are concerned I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing and of the movie as a whole If ever there was an actor s film it s this one Every actor gives a superb performance Some characters are better conceived than others and thus John Fiedler as the milquetoast of the bunch and Ed Binns as the working man are at somewhat of a disadvantage no fault of the actor Ed Begley s character a bigot starts out interestingly then descends into somewhat of a cliche which is too bad in way since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career Martin Balsam s sighing self pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden s loudmouth salesman I ve never seen Warden better than he is here His character is a jerk and a joker borderline Runyon or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life insufferable Warden plays for effect rather than charm and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him which tend to be unfavorable E G Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness Not a bad man just a snob of the sort one encounters often in the real world seldom in the movies Lee J Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain albeit a pathetic one of the piece while Henry Fonda s dissenter more or less wears the white hat Cobb gives the sort of highly charged emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront a bit quieter here and not so malevolent He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don t know they have demons Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on which is that of defender of the damned One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere that he s a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face often in close up or medium shot We see old faces and youngish ones the craggy and the smooth the granite jawed and the slack jawed There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes Some faces smile automatically others benignly some not at all With so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures it would be good for young directors to study 12 Angry Men to see just how much action there is in the human face I ll take this one over Pearl Harbor any old day',\n",

       "   'title': \"A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room\",\n",
       "   'review': 'As a directional debut you could do worse than Sidney Lumet s excellent 12 Angry Men It would be the beginning of an illustrious career even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again 12 Angry Men is apart from several opening shots closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room filmed completely in one single room To create a fascinating character driven tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge but Lumet s direction here is world class He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses Much has been said about Lumet s use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end as more people are convinced of the not guilty vote so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the guilty voters Even though the film is largely in a single room Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes the weather switches to pouring rain which is generally an even larger symbolism of chaos and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture 12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history with in particular Lee J Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime This is not just an angry character thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son This brings forth another point which are ofcourse all twelve characters All of these characters have some kind of background origin and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are All the while Lumet uses very long takes switching between mid shots wide shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible Later in the film when things start to heat up even more he also induces a fantastic use of the close up which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions Furthermore the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film as every single line of dialogue character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly Ofcourse we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given Due to Lumet s technical expertise visual mood setters claustrophic atmosphere the fantastic energetic acting it feels as a thriller in a drama setting Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture because we do not know anything about the case yet In the end whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law Every character however is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way Even Juror 3 who as stated before relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son As one of the best acted films of all time combined with a fantastic screenplay impeccable direction in depth character development and characterization 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made',\n",

       "   'review': 'The concept of Reasonable Doubt is highly pervasive within the Judicial System it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused and is the concept that is one of the most controversial It s controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition yet it is almost universally known In 12 ANGRY MEN Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time it doesn t in fact occur in the actual courtroom all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room where the verdict is hotly debated Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided As the film progresses the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in and the tension becomes increasingly high The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door The second was to cue the rain which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are inaccessible and that only the Room exists The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close up during the movie which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier The acting is top notch as required by any good character study All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film s 95 minute run time Henry Fonda is brilliant as the hesitant juror but to me Lee J Cobb outshines him in almost every scene save the opening scenes Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music or lack thereof This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a feel of the Room There is no Music in the Jury Room so why should there be in this film I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene sometimes the absence of the music silence speaks volumes by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene s One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN Another brilliant score less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture Best Director and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI Had the movie been made a year or two earlier it may well have won the esteemed accolades I can see why this film ranks in IMDb s All time Top 10 It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many 4 stars out of 4 8 10 Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so Strongly recommended',\n",

       "   'review': '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die 1 I m gonna do a series where I go through all the films in this book 2013 edition because I often feel like I don t watch enough classic movies There s just so bloody many throughout history that asking me to pick one at any given time is damn near impossible for me so having a pre made list like this is incredibly helpful to that end So I m going through them in alphabetical order rather than chronologically because I think jumping around to different time periods will keep it much more fresh And to kick things off even though a big reason for me doing this is that I say I haven t seen enough classics we ve got one that s been one of my favourites for nearly two years now 12 Angry Men is a film that I consider to be nothing short of a miracle frankly Of all the pre 1960 s films I ve seen which is not all that many to be honest I haven t enjoyed a huge amount of them although others include Paths Of Glory and Casablanca I ve always thought that back then while the acting could be amazing they just don t tend to have particularly interesting narratives or characters and the directing pales in comparison to what directors have been doing since Which only makes it even more amazing to me that I can t say any of that about 12 Angry Men Not only is it pristinely directed edited and shot and one of if not the best written courtroom drama ever made but aside from a few minor references to 50 s culture you could release this exact same film today word for word and it would still work It feels like it s barely aged a day And when I say pristinely directed I mean that The way Sidney Lumet frames whoever s talking and allows the camera to follow them around is just perfect And some shots where no one is talking are some of the most memorable in the film and some including me would even extend that to in cinematic history He also brilliantly used close ups more and more as the script went on which is a simple thing but it does wonders for the atmosphere As does the fact there s almost no soundtrack for the entire movie And the fact that it s nearly entirely set in one room And the pacing being flawless It s a really damn good film you know And something else that makes it just that good the performances Every single one of them There are some that are given less of a chance to shine than others because they re more side characters yes but at their worst they do what they need to do and are convincing as these jurors that don t get as much of a spotlight At best oh man Henry Fonda Lee J Cobb Jack Warden and more every single one of them is sodding phenomenal and the way the script so geniusly creates tension by giving virtually everyone a good and understandable or sometimes not so good or understandable reason for their initial guilty verdicts is brilliant It means that everyone has a different little thing that ll convince them otherwise and Henry Fonda s search for all of them is riveting I also love how much of a moral quandary the whole film could be as one of the jurors says fairly early on suppose the kid did knife his father and you talk us out of it and how shockingly relevant it is It made comments on systematic racism and arguably toxic masculinity in 1950 bloody 7 for christ s sake Like I said I really do consider this film especially for it to have been made in the time period it was nothing short of a miracle and if you ve never seen it then like man go watch it Like now ideally',\n",

       "   'review': 'I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before To put short this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list To be honest there s not a lot that one can comment about the film There are no special effects dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that s what makes this film the phenomenon that it is It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors in particular Henry Fonda that defines the film The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes or whatever i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead but oh what an ignorant error that would have been 12 Angry Men is magnificent',\n",

       "   'review': 'From a distance 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet s debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly the hottest day of the year A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder The defendant has everything going against him a couple of witnesses a murder weapon a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society Over the next 95 minutes 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors first convinced of the suspect s guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man s doubts about the accused s guilt Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close up and ably heightens the drama despite the confining setting The actors all 12 of them are top notch as the 12 Angry Men in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back If you love movies you owe it to yourself to see this one',\n",

       "   'review': 'This is one of the best films I have ever had the good fortune of watching A jury is nearly convinced that the accused is guilty One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be In the 90 minutes that follow this goes into these twelve individuals and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly This is a masterpiece and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted each excellent on their own and the mix of them all being so seamless Every character they are the focus of this if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well and the script is well written developed impeccably and credible This is quite realistic and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect it is not a documentary nor was it meant to be and do not take away from the whole The acting is perfect for all concerned This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting albeit the cinematography makes full use of it so no claustrophobia is induced The camera stays on the people follows them remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks and there are long takes Editing is impossibly subtle You forget that it s a movie Instead you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them A dozen men in a locked room determining if someone lives or dies This raises questions about the legal system as well Other than Serpico I haven t seen anything by Lumet but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this The DVD comes with the original trailer I recommend this to everyone 10 10',\n",

       "   'review': 'Hitchcock once said you could stage an entire film in a telephone box and 12 Angry Men triumphantly demonstrates the excitement that can be generated just by a bunch of guys talking around a table The dramatic highlight simply consists of a closeup of Juror 4 s face as the penny finally drops When I first saw this film at the age of 13 I knew nothing about it in advance and still vividly recall my mounting excitement when I realised that the action was going to be entirely confined to just the one room Although failing to win a single Oscar and dying at the boxoffice 12 Angry Men created enough to be parodied on Hancock and remained the film in which Henry Fonda took the most pride He later said he d commissioned Sydney Lumet to direct this version of Reginald Rose s television play because he knew that he d be good with actors but that his skill with the camera came as pure gain Films set in courtrooms are so common it s become a genre in it s own right but after nearly seventy years 12 Angry Men continues to stand in magnificent isolation as the sole film confined simply to the jury Since I originally saw this film as a teenager I have probably seen it again about half a dozen times and each time I discover something new it took several viewings for example to notice the way the other members of the cast routinely patronise the elderly juror and his often querulous response It s easy now to sneer that all twelve are white and male but the film might be discreetly making the very point that the defendant briefly seen at the very start whose life is in their hands is obviously hispanic one of what Juror 10 dismissively describes as them',\n",

       "   'review': 'Sidney Lumet s 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight forwardness as a film It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen year old living in the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father at their home We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes The man is Henry Fonda s character a man who like all but one other soul in the room remains nameless until the end of the film While he doesn t entirely believe the boy s innocence he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts With that the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other During this time the New York City heat is sweltering the fan in the room isn t working and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses Fonda s character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona albeit in a bitter shortchanging manner He is referred to as a golden boy sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty but can t be certain that he is guilty leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override One of the many intriguing things about Fonda s stance is his ability to go against the grain the slightest doubt in his mind at first the commonality of the boy s alleged murder weapon a pocketknife leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty How many people even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy s guilt and subsequent death Most people including myself probably would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self deprecation maybe I missed something we d think maybe I m just way off we d add before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote If Fonda s character would ve done that 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film not one of the greatest works of American cinema The key to the film s renowned qualities lies in a few places As stated the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda s character Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice Film critic Mike D Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O J Simpson of his murder charges The fact is we don t know at the end of it we weren t there we were never destined to be there and all we know is that one person is dead one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne The correctness or morality of the jurors decision isn t so much in question for I m sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well founded evidence This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film which is its ability to operate in several different genres The attributes of the film I just mentioned leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways makes it a biting mystery while the rapid fire investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime drama Finally there s the inherent melodrama of character relations with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice Ed Begley s character for example who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty Finally above all in some minds there s the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action As droll as the film may seem this is one of the most entertaining courtroom dramas I ve yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink the analysis of justice and legal practices and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt s I have ever seen',\n",

       "   'review': 'Being a film buff myself I d like to think I know good movies when I see them With 12 Angry Men all it took was a few scenes and I knew this was one of the great ones Not only was this movie important and influential it s also easily re watchable I ve seen it three times now and each time I pick up on new tidbits of information and dialogue that I missed the time before I would imagine it s not easy directing an ensemble of 12 in one small room but Sidney Lumet managed to do it and do it very well I often find crime drama s to be my favorite genre of movies in large part because of the suspenseful aspects of that particular storytelling While 12 Angry Men is far from a prototypical crime drama it s certainly suspenseful What begins as one man s doubts against 11 other men s desire to leave the courthouse as fast as possible ends with a powerful message of prejudices and class issues The nice thing about this particular criminal case is that at first listen it s hard to argue with what some of the men are saying There s definitely a grey area to this particular case and that proves to help the development of the suspense and third act revelations Perhaps even more important than the simple theme of class issues is the idea of communication and how far a little talking can take you As Henry Fonda nicely put it we have a reasonable doubt and that s something that s very valuable in our system No jury can declare a man guilty unless it s sure All of these men were under difficult conditions considering the small room and blistering heat but all of them also needed to understand that communicating with each other was the only way they were going to get through the night I loved the way Lumet gracefully gave every one of the actor s their time to shine Although Fonda was the clear star and likely had the most lines here every single one of them brought their A game The film also points out how easy it is to involve your own personal prejudices into cases like this Perhaps even to some viewers it may be hard to against the grain of 11 other angry men and vote not guilty but sometimes it takes more than just sitting around and waiting for someone else to step up Sometimes you have to be the one to point out the questionable things in whatever job field or discussion you are in Communication can be a difficult thing but if you re willing to listen to others share their opinion you should be willing to talk as well But I do know one thing that can t be disputed the greatness that is Sidney Lumet s 12 Angry Men 93 100',\n",

       "   'review': 'It seems that the message of 12 Angry Men above comes across as the film s only weakness It starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room where we spend the rest of the movie It seems an open and shut case and by a show of hands there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty and a single man who believes not that he is NOT guilty just that there is a CHANCE that he s not guilty The film s weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth The problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys and they rarely let you forget this as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks while the calm endlessly likable Henry Fonda heads up the good guy side Maybe the movie should have been called 11 Angry Men instead There is also a certain level of ham handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors The story is about how important such legal cases are because the decision that they make in that room will change someone s life forever and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision But at the beginning all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else They re talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do Sidney Lumet in his book Making Movies gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 Angry Men including the positioning of the camera watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts and his brilliant use of lighting Late in the movie as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don t even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on and when they do it s not just the room that is lighting up The performances themselves have not aged well but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion although I have to say that the film s other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re analyze or analyze for the first time should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial The jurors question for the first time for example the eyesight of the case s key eyewitness who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train I should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction too At any rate the film is a brilliant achievement given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room It reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials even when the result seems completely obvious The end of the movie is perfect as there is only one way that it could really end and I don t mean the jury s final decision and yet it is not predictable This is one of Lumet s most glowing achievements',\n",

       "   'review': 'If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system this movie is the one This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence Instead of being impartial the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury anything can happen This movie is great because the story is completely plausible Jurors ready to fight each other jurors who are angry who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors In short this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb it s really an ensemble cast Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue ranting and raving a really classic performance After watching this movie one can better understand why cases are plea bargained It has nothing to do with ensuring justice it s just a way to avoid having to go to trial by jury',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is one of the movies which doesn t particularly divide audiences virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece What is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense interest and topicality Not a line is wasted not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement Twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father Eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict The one thorn in their side is Henry Fonda who isn t totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more Slowly but surely he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open and shut case Sidney Lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance The sweltering hot weather adds to the mens frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations Fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of Lee J Cobb as the most aggressive and sharp tongued of his rivals There are superb performances also from Jack Warden as a juror who isn t especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time John Fiedler as a softly spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed Martin Balsam as the self appointed spokesman and Robert Webber as a rather self conscious ad executive Indeed every juror is played to perfection and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest The script by Reginald Rose is pure genius The whole story is told via talk there s no direct action and no fancy flashbacks yet it is enthralling from first minute to last See 12 Angry Men This is what film as a serious medium is all about',\n",

       "   'review': 'It s always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this And wherever you run into it prejudice always obscures the truth I don t really know what the truth is 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I ve seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end inside an enclosed room So why is this so good Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet This was actually Lumet s first feature film and among his best movies all time although it wasn t received really well when it first came out This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70 s made one great film after another Serpico Dog Day Afternoon and Network 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do Many great plays have failed to perform well in film so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character and this was achieved really well by Sidney The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men The film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young Spanish American is guilty or not of murdering his father He reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death The 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty Everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he s guilty even before beginning to debate the issue The first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he s guilty pointing to the clear evidence but Juror 8 Henry Fonda claims to have his doubts He isn t sure the guy is innocent but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man s life is in their hands Once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place The rest of the jury is played by Martin Balsam 1 John Fiedler 3 Lee J Cobb 4 E G Marshall 4 Jack Klugman 5 Edward Binns 6 Jack Warden 7 Joseph Sweeney 9 Ed Begley 10 George Voskovec 11 and Robert Webber 12 The debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another s arguments The small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story One of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios Many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible As the men debate we see how all of this plays out and Reginald Rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views There is no mention of names except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act Their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other This is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today These characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century Overall I believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers It is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda who have left us with their rich legacy http estebueno10 blogspot com',\n",

       "   'review': 'The 50s are known as the age of the big picture the epics and the uber budget monstrosities But it was also the era when the Indy film came of age and every now and then a mini budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios And 12 Angry Men is quite literally a small picture taking place almost exclusively on the one set It s unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage as was say Rope but from an earlier television edition testament to the growing influence of TV at that time This is the cinematic debut of director Sidney Lumet who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas he also did the job on Murder on the Orient Express and Dog Day Afternoon Already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space We begin rather objectively with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about We then gradually close in the shots becoming more personal Crucially the camera now often follows actors around as they move especially the restless Ed Begley to get that more aggravated feel to the shots Finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument Lumet shows his inexperience some shots don t match up very well and the close ups are too close but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction Such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting Henry Fonda gives a subtle considered performance showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors but about the implications of the trial and the life that is at stake Fonda clearly understands that Juror 8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility Lee J Cobb gives a performance of great power and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture Honourable mentions also go to George Voskovec and Martin Balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors 12 Angry Men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work not to mention a really neatly structured one But is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat It ought to be entirely believable entirely smooth and unforced in feel and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated The writer s thought processes are too much on display I m talking for example about the way Juror 3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment And while it s true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped and the twee acting styles of Joe Sweeney and John Winnie the Pooh Fiedler don t help None of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 Angry Men tumbling to the ground don t get me wrong this is still a mighty picture but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones',\n",

       "   'review': 'Generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema with theatrical potential at best but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film a solitary location a hasty shoot budget constraints and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of one of the greatest motion pictures of all time would be a title hardly disputed by the general public Lumet s persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 Angry Men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified While the legal thriller is always a precarious genre walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience Lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms What makes Fonda s Juror 8 s solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation Fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party s innocence in fact he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer Instead Fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence notions that Lumet s film toys with throughout as its Rashomon style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society s constant yearning for information and knowledge Taking similar notes from Hitchcock s Rear Window the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator but crucially just like the jurors the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed Eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions And although Lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels by the end the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it The jury s cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath Masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth the elderly woman witness testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic Indeed the film could hardly be farther from it as Lumet s remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers Perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist Such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect and Lumet s uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance No one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist Juror 8 than the time etched monolith of American honesty and decency that is Henry Fonda and Fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors Fonda s unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible and his character all the more timeless Lee J Cobb similarly shines as the abrasive Juror 3 with Cobb s fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force and far more resonant Martin Balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed Juror 1 with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life What could have made for a plodding overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance 12 Angry Men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find its reputation as one of the strongest American films of all time holding up and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest 10 10',\n",

       "   'review': 'One of the all time greatest character driven works in the history of film making It s even more remarkable when you realize nearly the entire story with the exception of a prologue and epilogue each less than a minute in length takes place in one room Henry Fonda as the lone juror who stands for the acquittal of an accused murderer is probably the best remembered performer but his 11 co stars turned in astonishingly powerful characterizations as well It s a who s who of TV and film heavyweights and no one misses a beat anywhere The Black White filming style echoes the story s simple one act play origin aiming your focus on the actors and their high intensity lines all the way through Clever elements like an oppressively hot room and later a thunderstorm add some symbolic salt and pepper but the actors are all commanding your attention so well that you don t even need such measures The jurors come from all walks of life with their own views of the world and life itself the result is a fiery encounter with sparks everywhere You are drawn in from the start and each character becomes a real person Bigotry broken families ambivalence self focus patriotism loneliness fear confusion apathy pride arrogance these are just some of the elements explored in this microcosmic analysis of the human condition and what makes us who we are The court system is held up as a high lofty principal the integrity of which must be fought for if it is to work A great artistic endeavor with one of the finest scripts ever written Everyone should see this film',\n",

       "   'review': 'In this Sidney Lumet s debut feature we re taken into the jury room as twelve jurors deliberate over the fate of a young man accused of murder All of the evidence points to a guilty verdict but one juror is determined to explore every possibility for reasonable doubt lest they send an innocent man to his death One remarkable thing about this film is that it unfolds almost completely in real time within a single room While that might sound like a limitation Sidney Lumet managed to keep the visuals interesting throughout resulting in a well deserved Oscar nomination Meanwhile Reginald Rose s taut Oscar nominated script deserves equal credit for keeping the narrative flowing Lastly and perhaps most importantly the cast is stellar Henry Fonda turned in a solid performance in the lead role and all of the supporting actors gave it their all In my mind the standout performances came from Lee J Cobb Ed Begley Jack Warden However the group as a whole is a diverse one and each of the actors contributes a unique piece to the puzzle My only complaint a minor one is that the mechanics of the script are sometimes overly apparent particularly in the early stages when Fonda s character supposedly has only a vague apprehension about certain pieces of evidence Luckily when the story unfolds it is compelling enough that I can forgive the screenwriter s dramatic license in setting up the events At the moment this film is rated 8 among the top 250 films on this site I think that it definitely deserves a spot on the list but the current ranking seems somewhat generous especially when you consider that it s above the likes of Casablanca Seven Samurai Chinatown 2001 A Space Odyssey and several other highly acclaimed films So by all means see this movie but don t be surprised if it doesn t turn out to be one of the ten best films of all time',\n",

       "   'review': 'Most courtroom dramas tell the story of a trial and typically most films of the genre center on the building of the cases the trial in a courtroom and the climactic moment the jury renders the final verdict In 12 Angry Men we see none of these aspects We don t see the trial we don t see the lawyers and we don t see how the case was built Almost the entire story is told in the confines of a jury room The indisputable facts and the prosecution s case trickle in as the story progresses There s a brief prelude where we see the courtroom the judge and a brief shot of the boy on trial for murder This is the world of 12 Angry Men Except for a brief courtroom shot and one other codetta scene at the end 12 Angry Men spends about 90 of its 96 minutes running time inside a claustrophobic room where the fan doesn t work and it s supposed to be the hottest day of the year Twelve men from differing backgrounds and age groups are put together to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder Fairly quickly we learn that an older middle age man was murdered in an apartment and his son in his late teens has been accused of the crime Two witnesses during the trial testified it was the boy a woman across the street and an older gentleman in an apartment just above the apartment where the crime took place Without giving two much away the story begins with an initial poll taken by the jurors Almost all of them believe the boy is guilty except one juror no 8 Henry Fonda The trial occurred over the course of six days and all of them seem a bit worn out In addition each juror seems to have differing agendas which start to rear their ugly heads Juror no 3 Lee J Cob is one of two jurors who has a personal agenda about the trial The other is juror no 10 Ed Begley who constantly talks about those people and repeatedly stands from his chair when he hears evidence which might contradict the probably guilt of the accused Juror No 5 Jack Klugman is a soft spoken young man who grew up in the slums like the defendant Juror no 7 Jack Warden is a sports fan who cares less about the trial and doesn t want to miss a sporting event taking place in the evening There s a kindly and wise older gentleman juror no 9 who turns out to have unexpected wisdom Joseph Sweeney And Martin Balsam plays the foreman of the jury who can t seem to keep the group from going at each other s throats Juror no 8 at first can t seem to convince anyone there s any reason to doubt the guilt of the accused Even when he says he simply wishes to talk about the case many of the jurors dismiss him He then takes a chance and asks the others for a re vote in which he abstains If the other 11 jurors still vote guilty he s willing to take the verdict into the court A brilliantly acted one scene film about the possibly dynamic of a jury room Many real life juries have taken many hours sometimes days to reach verdicts Other verdicts have been rendered in seemingly short periods of time Each actor owns his character and as the discussion continues the prejudices and irrationalities of the characters gradually reveal themselves Interestingly we have the notion that juries should be objective in their verdicts but 12 Angry Men poses the question do verdicts reflect personal prejudices as much or in some cases more than simply reviewing and determining objective facts',\n",

       "   'review': 'This classic movie has an excellent cast of well known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system From the beginning it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process they were impulsive lacking in compassion ignorant of the law and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves except for two or three This wedge enabled Henry Fonda the lone dissenting voice at the start to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty During the process of passing judgement the jury is subject to an intense self examination of their own prejudices and opinions As the movie goes along the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility The foreman Martin Balsam takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom At one point one of the last holdouts E G Marshall playing an unemotional and stone faced juror was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions We see similar cutaways to Lee J Cobb who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law',\n",

       "   'review': 'I wonder what it must have been like for Sidney Lumet to direct a perfect film for his feature film debut Lumet had worked on television shows before directing his 1957 film 12 Angry Men a debut film examining justice and the motivation behind people s actions and the motivation behind their decisions when a group of jurors decides whether to convict a young man of a murder that would result in his being sentenced to death First developed for a CBS Studio One anthology television series Reginald Rose wrote 12 Angry Men and developed it into a teleplay in 1954 Lumet s version is still thought of by many as a perfect film 60 years after its release With an all star cast including Henry Fonda Martin Balsam Lee J Cobb and Jack Klugman among others 12 Angry Men is my personal favorite film to watch when I want to see a collection of the best acting talent What I wouldn t give to have been in the theatres during the first run of 12 Angry Men I can only imagine the audience reaction to such a powerful yet understated film Alas I was born in the wrong time and instead of being able to head to the cinema and see 12 Angry Men I m here buying tickets for The Emoji Movie A desperate teenager is seen staring longingly at the men who just heard his case exiting the jury stall He knows they will be the ones deciding his fate The young man is on trial for the murder of his father and if convicted will face the death penalty From the outside his case looks open and shut He had an argument with his father that was overheard by neighbors he owned a knife which was the same weapon used to kill his father and he had previous grievances with the law Most of the jurors file into their sequestered room assuming they won t be in long as the verdict seems clear One juror however has doubts and refuses to cast a vote for guilty without at least discussing the case as they ve been assigned to do Begrudgingly the jurors begin to discuss the case sure that their minds won t be changed One by one however further examination of the evidence and the factors involved in the case reveal the motivations each man had used to inform their decision was less based on evidence and more so on their own biases An exploration of the human psyche and what motivates our thought processes 12 Angry Men has more than earned its place as one of American cinema s best The opening credit sequence of 12 Angry Men was a divine long shot achieved at a high angle through a fan that would provide a source of tension throughout the film of each of the jurors filing into the room preparing to see to the matters of the case After their opening vote reveals only one holdout mob mentality takes over as a few vocal members of the majority intend on proving to Henry Fonda s juror 8 why their view on the matter is more accurate than his In doing so they also reveal their biases and the different factors driving their decision Whether it s the lonely brokenness of a severed relationship or attempting to assert dominance to shield one s own powerlessness each man is operating with far more than the facts of the case driving them The lengths Lumet went to conceal the names of the jurors was one of the best decisions he made to drive home the universality of the film s message At one point a court worker asks one of the jurors his name and he points to it on the clip board held by the court worker In a typical situation one would have just said their name out loud but Lumet s stroke of brilliance avoided names being used through the entire runtime of the film allowing audiences the chance to see themselves in the characters depicted on screen Whether we are aware or not and whether we act on them or not we are all driven by personal biases We learn the set of biases that drive us as we mature first from our immediate familial surroundings then from the people we surround ourselves with and the circumstances we endure If those biases are negative it is our responsibility to analyze them and see that we eradicate them As a character study 12 Angry Men is top notch with no small thanks owed to the exceptional cast Every single name on the credits list is that of a well established actor of the time Martin Balsam Lee J Cobb E G Marshall Jack Klugman Ed Begley and Henry Fonda are only half the cast and each known by an extensive body of work One exceptional aspect which also points to Lumet s directorial prowess he possessed even from his feature film debut is how improbable it is that this film would be such a success One setting films with small casts and rich in dialogue are not the easiest films to pull off yet you d be hard pressed to find someone who won t give accolades to 12 Angry Men Not once through the runtime is the film static nor does it lose the engagement of the audience Lumet ends the film in a sensational way as well When Fonda helps Cobb with his coat after the two were the fiercest of adversaries during deliberations Lumet communicated to the audience that we are all capable of seeing past what initially drives our motives and can possibly overcome them and come together on the other side Then just before the film ends we learn Fonda s name and see he and another juror uncomfortably stand on the courthouse steps not knowing what to say to one another Despite having gone through an emotional afternoon together they don t know each other and don t have much to say to one another',\n",

       "   'title': 'One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable And Powerful Classic From Sidney Lumet.',\n",
       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable Classic from Sidney Lumet that combines amazing direction a terrific cast a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 Angry Men one of my favorite films Sidney Lumet at his best and cinema at it s best Set in New York City 12 Angry Men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who s been accused of murdering his Father While the 11 other jurors think the boy s guilty and the case is open and shut one juror juror 8 Henry Fonda Isn t so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror 3 Lee J Cobb verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty 12 Angry Men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director Sidney Lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made What separates 12 Angry Men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other Courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom 12 Angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room Right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights explosions fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time When you watch 12 Angry Men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that 12 Angry Men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it s about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well developed and interesting The film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant Another thing I love about 12 Angry Men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere Boris Kaufman s black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie s intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark I also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 Angry Men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out Also the fact that 12 Angry Men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat When you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen All the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number 8 and 3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film Juror 8 Isn t convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case You will root and relate to juror 8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops Where as juror 8 thinks the boy Isn t guilty juror 3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror 3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case Juror 8 and 3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film The screenplay by Reginald Rose is terrific with Rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers The ending of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget A powerful and outstanding conclusion The whole cast is amazing in their roles Henry Fonda is excellent and at his best as Juror 8 with Fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role Lee J Cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as Juror 3 with Cobb bringing intensity anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with Fonda E G Marshall is terrific as Juror 4 an intelligent stockbroker Joseph Sweeney is wonderful as Juror 9 an observant and elderly juror Ed Begley is riveting as Juror 10 a man full of racism hate and prejudice Jack Warden is outstanding as Juror 7 with Warden bringing humor to the film Jack Klugman is fantastic as Juror 12 a man with a slum background George Voskovic is sensational as Juror 11 a European Juror John Fiedler Juror 2 Martin Balsam Juror 1 The Foreman Robert Webber Juror 12 and Edward Binns Juror 6 give great performances as well The direction by Sidney Lumet is amazing and stylish with Lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close ups over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style Terrific direction Lumet The score Kenyon Hopkins is great memorable and intense and matches the film s tone Amazing score Hopkins In final word if you love Sidney Lumet Henry Fonda Courtroom Dramas or cinema I highly suggest you see 12 Angry Men an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again Highly Recommended 10 10',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men A Masterpiece Directed by Sidney Lumet Written by Reginald Rose from his own teleplay Starring Henry Fonda Lee J Cobb E G Marshall Martin Balsam Jack Warden John Fiedler Jack Klugman Edward Binns Joseph Sweeney Ed Begley George Voskovec Robert Webber Sidney Lumet s first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose Twelve men debate the fate of a Puerto Rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father Eleven jurors think he is guilty and one Fonda thinks he is innocent The amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial The two do not way each other out however Lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of Fonda s character Reginald Rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing Lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film s relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play Lumet s career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful but this is certainly not mediocre in any way It makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this This also serves as one of the many high points in the career of Henry Fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as E G Marshall Ed Begley and Jack Warden The impact this film had on Lumet and Hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is a drama film directed by Sidney Lumet The film tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant based on reasonable doubt forcing the jurors to question their morals and values In the United States a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous The defendant is an 18 year old male There are two witnesses a lady from across the street and an old man who lives below the defendant This is hands down my favorite film of all time I could watch it repeatedly and never get sick of it It s so well crafted and damn perfect in every way It s a classic and when they attempted to remake it in 1997 it just didn t hold up to the beauty and standard that this film laid out It s master craft filmmaking at it s finest Henry Fonda is a standout in this movie he is great Being made in the 1950 s I was very impressed with all of the acting involved with this movie but Henry Fonda was my favorite That is in part with the dialogue that this movie has for his character It s so realistic and believable and it is executed brilliantly Every actor did a great job bringing their character to life especially since none of them are given a name and we just know them as Jury Member 1 2 3 and so on I have nothing negative to say about this movie which is crazy because every movie is said to have some flaws I see none here The acting is great the story is entertaining and real and the cinematography is breathtaking The way they use long shots and move the camera steadily around the room to capture different conversation in the beginning was fantastic Also there is one other long take that is worth mention It involves this older gentleman and he is getting tired and angry that this situation is taking so long He starts to talk about the suspects ethnicity and saying he is guilty because his kind is always guilty and they should all be put away He keeps talking for the course of about 3 minutes and we slowly see every other jury member stand up from the table and walk away silently and ignoring him This scene was so powerful one because of the dialogue but another is because it is one long scene and you feel what the other jurors are feeling the more the man speaks anger Overall this is still my favorite movie of all time I have never seen a movie that made me feel the way I feel every time I see it I think this movie has something for everybody even if you re not a fan of black and white films I beg you to give this film a chance',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is not an extravagant movie Most of the film takes place inside a small jury room no extravagant sets in this movie This gives us incentive to focus on the three strengths of the film the acting the dialogue written by Reginald Rose and the direction by first time director Sidney Lumet The acting is outstanding There is a long shot that takes place before any talk of the case and simply based off this shot we can tell so much about these characters which way they will vote whether they can relate to the boy on trial and which of them will collide in the future Special mentions of course go to Lee J Cobb and Henry Fonda the two opposites whose conversations are some of the most interesting in the whole movie Lee J Cobb s revelation scene at the end of the movie alone shows how multilayered he can play his characters The dialogue is spectacular and I am of the opinion it is one of the best scripts ever written for the movie screen possibly the best Every character speaks based on their motivations Juror 5 speaks based on his experience as a kid from the poorer areas Juror 3 speaks based on his own son and Juror 7 speaks based on his desire to get to a baseball game These motivations color their arguments and distinguish each of them from their peers and ths is exemplified in the script This film also contains the single greatest line in film history delivered by Juror No 8 to Juror No 3 after No 3 threatens his life When you watch the scene you ll know the line And finally the directing is masterful The film s limited set means that the director Sidney Lumet had to come up with creative ways to frame shots to aid the film s storytelling He does this by shooting in wide shots at the start of the movie and slowly bringing the camera closer to the actor s faces putting more emphasis on their reactions and reinforcing the claustrophobic size of the room The scene where the men walk into the outside at the end is basically catharsis 12 Angry Men is a smart and engaging movie and feels like it was made with every element completely fine tuned to make one of the greatest movies of all time I think this movie needs to be seen by everyone not just to enjoy it but to see how dialogue can be used masterfully to enhance a story',\n",

       "   'review': 'This is one of those great films that at the time it is made tackles a difficult subject but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject s definitive movie reference point The story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father Given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel the case seems to be open and shut He didn t know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene Chances of mistakes well let s face it none He ll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair In Sidney Lumet s supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script storytelling or performance The acting within this drama is superb and Henry Fonda is magic as Juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused Everyone in the room is superb in their role with a special nod to Jack Klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from Joseph Sweeney as the shrewd eyed Juror number 9 is also fantastic but for me E G Marshall and Lee J Cobb Arguably the most underrated American character actor are magnificent in their roles as Juror s 4 and 3 the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and Lee J consumed by anger over his own child s independence and taking that out in the jury room It is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that although some of our current generation may find stagy and un dynamic is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world and not necessarily for them',\n",

       "   'review': '12 angry men must be one of the most unpretentious classics ever The reason I say this is because most classics either have a reputation for being long epics about war and love ala Gone with the wind or for being slow moving movies which may not be accessible to all ala Citizen Kane But this one was different It is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man s fate The whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room And it deals with human nature and how people behave when in a group These are universal themes that anybody can relate to The style is also very simple with no unnecessary complications or flashy camera work 12 jurors are now required to take a tough decision to decide about the guilt of a young 18 year old boy If found guilty he would be put to death At the beginning most jurors are in agreement over his guilt except for one of them That is Juror no 8 Played by Henry Fonda One of the jurors then gives an opinion that the rest of the jurors should try to justify their decision to juror no 8 The arguments go back and forth till the end These exchanges are very interesting because of the emotional nature of the discussions Most of the jurors have set opinions on social issues and these are exposed during the discussions Objectivity is in short supply and juror no 4 a stockbroker is notable in his objective analysis Juror no 11 played by George Voskovec is also notable for his detailed analysis and opinions on the case Juror no 7 is noticeably disinterested in discussing the case as he has already made up his mind over the guilt of the accused He in fact is more interested in the baseball game in the same night and in cracking jokes when serious discussions are in progress I did laugh at most of them One of them about a hair splitters convention was especially hilarious Juror no 3 is one of the jurors who are convinced about the boy s guilt He becomes too emotionally involved with the case and details and at one time even moves to punch Juror no 8 before he is held back by others Juror no 2 is usually timid but gives valid arguments when asked for his opinion His exchanges are also sometimes quite funny Juror no 5 is another person whose opinions are clouded because of his past perceptions and opinions Juror no 1 is a man who tries to direct the group and he does his best to break up unnecessary arguments Juror no 12 is an advertising executive who is quite self assured and confident at the beginning but then becomes doubtful about his opinions on the case He sways back and forth based on the evidence presented and the arguments laid on the table He tries to crack jokes and often the others don t find it very amusing But once he makes an off the cuff remark and most of the jurors find it funny It is scenes like these and the attention to detail that make the movie special Juror no 9 is an old man who has lots of life experiences and speaks on the basis of that regarding the case He also brings up some very good points especially one towards the end Henry Fonda is obviously the center of attention With his kind eyes and his screen presence he is definitely the pick of the actors Jack Warden Juror no 7 with his great sense of humour and easy natural acting style is one of my personal favourites It is quite unusual for a fifties film Lee Cobb s performance as Juror no 3 was the most emotionally charged role in the whole movie and he has given a powerful performance that at times gave me goosebumps This is one of the best acting performances on film George Voskovec as Juror no 11 the immigrant watchmaker is also quite good and he is especially good in the scene where he confronts Jack warden about his decision That scene is my favorite in the film E G Marshall as the stockbroker juror no 4 gives an excellent performance as the impassive and objective man who gives his opinions in a detached manner without any emotional connection whatsoever The others are also great in their respective roles I didn t expect to like this movie based on the premise but instead I loved this movie and it has become one of my favourites This movie has great replay value and this is because of the great performances and the smooth screenplay which doesn t have one unnecessary scene which might drag the movie This is one of the classics that might appeal to a large majority of people unless they get turned off by the premise itself This is Sydney Lumet s masterpiece and it is such an original idea that it deserves to be placed as one of the great classics of cinema 10 10',\n",

       "   'review': 'SPOILERS Given what at first glance seems to be an open and shut case by The State of New York vrs George Savoca in the murder by Mr Savoca stabbing of his father As the foreman of the Jury juror 1 Martin Balsam takes a vote from the 12 jurors including himself he gets an 11 to 1 vote for the conviction of Mr Savoca The lone dissenter is Juror 8 Henry Fonda who wants the defendant who if convicted automatically gets the death penalty to at least have his case reviewed and debated before he and the rest of the Jurors make a decision that may very well cost Mr Savoca his life At first the debate goes nowhere until it becomes clear that the switchblade that Savoca was accused of using to murdered his father was not that unique The fact that Juror 8 produced an exact same switchblade that he bought in a store some two blocks from the Savoca s home changed all that Slowly one after another the men on the jury change their vote with Juror 9 and 5 Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman being the first two to change their vote from conviction to acquittal The entire murder case hinged on the two eye witnesses a lame old man and a near sighted middle aged woman to the murder who lived across the street from the building where the murder was committed The witnesses testimony was taken apart by both juror 8 and 9 when it was discovered that the old man couldn t have gotten as he testified at the murder trial as fast to the window to see the murder committed As for the woman who was asleep the murder was committed after midnight she could not have gotten out of bed and seen from some 60 feet away through the windows of a passing fast moving subway train the killing without having her glasses on The film 12 angry Men ends with the only holdout of the jurors to acquit Juror 3 Lee J Cobb breaking down and finally voting to acquit Mr Savoca Fine courtroom drama that is as thought provoking now as it was back then on the screen in 1957 with every one involved giving Academy Award caliber performances even though there were a number of factors that were overlooked by the jurors that may well have proved Mr Savoca guilt The knife that killed Savoca s the same kind of knife that Savoca said that he had but lost the night of the murder father was found on the street outside his apartment Even though Juror 8 bought an exact copy of the switchblade knife that Savoca was said to have used in a store not far from him home it still didn t prove his innocence The fact that Savoca couldn t explain where he was convincingly the time that his father was murdered he claimed he was in a movie house where no one working there or any customer could identify him Being the one and only suspect in his fathers murder with a motive to boot he got into a fierce fight with his father and said that he was going to kill him a few hours before Savoca s father was murdered It was the eye witness testimony that failed to convince the jurors that had them vote to acquit him As convincing as the movie was in the jury acquitting Savoca in real life the jury would have in all probability have ended up by not coming to a verdict and ending up a hung jury Two of the jurors 10 and 7 Ed Begley Sr and Jack Warden were more or less motivated to vote for acquittal by being intimidated and pressured by their fellow jurors then by the testimony Juror 3 Lee J Cobb was so unstable and emotionally screwed up that it s a wonder that he ever got on the jury in the first place unless he was such a good actor that he fooled the State prosecutor when he was paneled by him',\n",

       "   'review': 'An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist Instead of following the trial itself the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room The film begins with the end of the trial The jurors retire to deliberate the case A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11 1 in favour of the guilty verdict Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father Only Juror 8 has doubts At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all But not everyone is easy to convince Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and near flawless acting Juror 1 a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out He appears at ease only once during the film when he talks about football He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury a task he clearly does not relish Juror 2 a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance Apparently he finds solace in his job he is an accountant Juror 3 probably the most complex personality in the film Starts off like a pleasant self made successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability Wonderfully played by Lee J Cobb this is the character you remember after the film is over Juror 4 self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot day Juror 5 here is a man under great emotional stress He comes from the same social background as the accused boy with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty he does not want compassion to influence him so ironically it does Juror 6 a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake Juror 7 the only one that really has no opinion on this case Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it s worth the bother Juror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds Juror 9 a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case Juror 10 the most horrifying character in the film Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy s social background The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy s which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference Juror 11 an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken respects the right of people to have different opinion to his and is willing to look at both sides of the problem Loses his temper only once horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7 Juror 12 a young business type perhaps he has his own opinions but is careful to hide them What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think The film succeeds in doing something very rare today developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters',\n",

       "   'title': \"A film so good, you'll feel like you've gained insight into life and humanity\",\n",
       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is a film that s so good and so powerful that as the credits roll you actually feel like you ve gained a deeper understanding of humanity our justice system and life in general I mean it It s really that good Twelve jurors of varying ages personalities cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father It s quite a simple premise a jury s deliberation one that occurs daily all over the United States But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension drama and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it s impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task to search for the truth in a case of life and death First things first let s just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room and tells its story completely through dialogue And yet it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces The dialogue is so well written and the characters so well realized and acted that you become completely swept up in the proceedings The pacing is also pitch perfect The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters and we as the audience catch our breaths and process what has developed And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds So yes 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour and a half running time But it s also so much more than that It s a film about truth its elusiveness malleability and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind Yes there is a single objective truth to this and likewise any real life case but the jurors don t know it and neither do we The objective truth isn t the point The point is the impressionability of the truth how it morphs in the minds of the characters and in ours over the course of the film and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions past experiences memory and its limitations prejudices and a myriad of other factors The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system The beauty as Henry Fonda s character points out is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt The folly The subjectivity of reasonable doubt and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors But ultimately 12 Angry Man a film about us people Each juror in the film has a unique personality temperament and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well balanced The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme the danger of assumption and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant as well as one another But even beyond that the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap judgments from us as we watch It s extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the good guys and the dissenting guilty proponent jurors as the bad guys To invoke a psychiatric concept we engage in splitting seeing some of the jurors as all good and others as all bad We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them But in its revealing final moments the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question why Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently What drives them to act in the way that they do No one is born prejudiced bigoted or racist These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own The angry prejudiced juror isn t inherently all bad but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience much of which is subconscious Of course that doesn t mean that people can t and shouldn t be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities But that isn t the point The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides As Juror 3 who we ve likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film the message couldn t be clearer 12 Angry Men is a masterpiece It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should It s fabulously entertaining and engrossing fantastically shot and acted perfectly paced and extremely thought provoking An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance',\n",

       "   'review': 'Before nineteen fifty seven Sidney Lumet was an up and coming television series director with a number of different shows to his name Talented the man obviously was even at that early stage of his career Meanwhile in fifty six Fonda has seen the TV play by Reginald Rose of the same name and had contacted him to see if the script could be adapted to a feature length version for the silver screen Subsequently they became co producers and financed the film themselves one of the greatest films ever made and put onto celluloid When filming began which unbelievably only took nineteen days and three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or around three million today Lumet would show the world just what an accomplished director he not only was but would go on to be throughout the rest of his career He truly belongs in the list of great American directors of all time if not also the world His vision skill with the camera and obtaining the very best from his actors is second to none 12 Angry Men shows all of his mastery and more and was Oscar nominated for it as he draws you deeper and closer into a story with a surprising amount of complex layers As just stated while seemingly a rather simple story 12 Angry Men does have numerous layers of complexity and social issues These include bigotry racial tensions social standing prejudices personalities and morality All of these issues can be seen within our twelve jurors throughout the course of the film while deciding the innocence of guilt of a boy on trial for murdering his father At its most basic structure this is a courtroom drama with a simple tale that is woven into an intricate compelling and gritty drama piece A wonderful show of how the judicial system should work The fate of a young ethnic boy lies in the hands of a jury mostly made up of middle aged white men The entire film with the exception of a very brief setup and epilogue takes place within one small claustrophobic room on a very hot day We see nor hear any of the trial witnesses or prosecution and only have a brief charge from the judge Everything we learn about the boy the case and all other matters we learn from our twelve jurors As they file into this room we then quickly start to see which character is which personality and for what they stand and believe in From this moment on you will be completely gripped Guilty until proven innocent and beyond all reasonable doubt are two importan phrases here and form the basis of the script and the conflict among our jurors In life far too many are quick to judge along with also being judge jury and executioner at times Lkewise some of our jurors share the same thoughts One man alone stands true to his beliefs and morality that the boy cannot be convicted unless there the crime can be proven beyond all doubt an act the prosecution or accuser has to prove not the defense Something some people along with our jury sometimes struggle to grasp with the preconceptions This one man who beholds the rights of the constitution is juror number eight Ford who is the initial voice of reason within the group Unlike many other reviews I will not spoil who is which character and what personal and prejudicial traits they have so you can ejoy finding out for yourself I will however praise every single cast member each one is wonderfully portrayed by seasoned and professional television actors We have the meek the controlling the bully the racist educated reserved indecisive and the impatient as well as other character traits All are shown brilliantly but special mention must go to Lee J Cobb for his acting Perfectly cast and intense in his performance that his character will stay with you long after the credits have rolled Likewise with the acting the script is simply superb Tight accurate and full of little twists and nuances this is perhaps one of the best scripts you will ever hear spoken Denzil Washington take note this is how you write a dialogue heavy screenplay No car crashes explosions fights foul language action scenes just a taught expose of truths and half truths spoken with conviction and heart from all those involved You won t find many more films as utterly compulsive as this one A real lesson to be learnt for any budding screen writer As is the direction and cinematography which are both second to none and while simple in concept are exucted to precise perfection it is often said that the simplest things are life are the hardest to master Lumet and Kaufman master them with ease and give the film its extra edge that it needed Kaufman who had previously worked on On the Waterfront is amazing and shows off his skill along with Lumet In using techniques to make the room look smaller and to close in on the actors make the room appear to be closing in on those twelve jurors the increasing tension between the men is really heightened at key moments Lumet also used different lenses and differing camera angles and heights to change or raise the mood as was needed Many do not notice a testement to his skill and the absorbing acting but Lumet changes the height of the camera during the distinct thirds the film is broken into slowly but surely ramping up the intensity and claustrophobia on us the viewer while we see the same increase on the twelve jurors Masterfully done A film that has an intelligent plot with a couple of little inconsistencies believable characters and one of the few to be accurately labelled as a classic in every way imaginable About as perfect as you will ever get The Sage s Rating 10

       "   'title': \"'12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic\",\n",
       "   'review': 'The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour issues which will forever be relevant At the beginning 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused an 18 year old Latino from the slums be executed by the state Initially this seems unremarkable you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict However it s soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts reaching their damning conclusion because they just think he s guilty there s even one juror who can t wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game Only Juror 8 Henry Fonda is disturbed by the hastiness of it all he doesn t know whether the kid is guilty he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death I ve praised films such as Killer Joe for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations However compared to 12 Angry Men Killer Joe is a veritable action adventure this legal drama never leaves the jury room Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose At the table sits a spectrum of personalities all of whom you can identify and resonate with Some are measured some are fickle some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig headed and obnoxious The natural timeless performances allow you to cross examine them they are all personalities one has come across before and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know this is one of the film s core strengths Sidney Lumet s debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments but to my relief I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility 12 Angry Men is a film I truly admire a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date',\n",

       "   'review': 'In my continuing quest of watching IMDb s top rated films I rented 12 Angry Men Currently this film is ranked 18 on the list With names like Reginald Rose Henry Fonda and Sidney Lumet the movie seemed very promising 12 Angry Men was also another example of bringing yet another well received teleplay to the big screen as had been done very successfully with Rod Serling s Patterns and Paddy Chayevsky s Marty Others here eloquently provide detail on the plot and characters Simply put the movie is filmed almost entirely on a single set the jury holding room of a courthouse where a jury of 12 men are deliberating the fate of a young man accused of murder Many plays and musicals have been adapted for the screen and the list of failures is long A notable recent example for me was Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead Film viewers do not have the same expectations of a presentation as do theater viewers In film the expectation of greater variety and coloration is a prerequisite due to the viewer s previous experiences Therefore the danger of becoming stagebound can ruin a film s reception For a play such as 12 Angry Men where the focus is declamatory this is an unavoidable danger Happily I found the film to be a resounding success The strength of Rose s adaptation is complemented by Lumet s probing camera which delineates the characters not only through impressive tight focus shots but through body language gesture and facial expression The ensemble acting underpinned by Henry Fonda s performance is superb as one would expect with such brilliant character actors as Lee J Cobb E G Marshall and Ed Begley Sr The storyline moves propulsively to a logical but powerful conclusion I can t really think of any flaws Some confrontations involving prejudicial statements are a bit obvious but are unfortunately as relevant today as then I wouldn t rate this as 18 on my list I found the aforementioned Patterns to be a more engrossing film but it s undoubtedly close to a classic Kudos to all I give it a 9',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men Written by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet 12 Angry Men is about a jury who starts off 11 1 for guilty of a murder case It s up to Juror 7 to show reasonable doubt The film is an ensemble cast with great direction Wide shots inside a jury room allow for whatever the main focus of the shot to also include the acting of others behind or along side Continuous acting and if in the hands of a different director like say Scorsese or Spielberg I would have imagined one long 90 minute take Juror 7 played by Henry Fonda best know for The Grapes of Wrath and Once Upon a Time in the West is the main holdout who goes on to try and convince the other jurors who have their reasons to think he s guilty Some are just going along with the crowd some have personal issues and some just aren t convinced Fonda does a great job acting as an every man with some doubt Juror 1 played by Martin Balsam best known for Breakfast at Tiffany s and Psycho is the person who is in charge of voting and for the most part keeps his opinions to himself Juror 3 played by Lee J Cobb best known for The Exorcist is by far the most interesting if not most stubborn character in the film He yells is arrogant and has it in his mind that the boy murdered his father It s not until the final minutes of the film that you get to know more about his character but boy is it worth it Juror 7 played by Jack Warden best known for All the President s Men but I first saw him in Problem Child as Big Ben He plays a baseball fan that just wants to get out of the room as soon as possible so he can go see a ball game It was great seeing him throw in little chimes every now and then as jabs towards the other jurors opinions causing more anger See title This film lost three Oscars to The Bridge on the River Kwai A movie that s now on my to see list With it s wonderful acting it only makes me want to see the other more Verdict Best ensemble cast movie I ve ever seen For a movie that doesn t change location it has surpassed Reservoir Dogs and Saw That means a lot Go rent buy this film',\n",

       "   'review': 'I m not a fan of old movies but this film was very compelling and excellenly directed Unlike other legal dramas the entire film takes place in the juror room The beginning of the movie starts out with the jurors leaving to deliberate and a single shot of the man whose fate they have to decide on I normally would have been bored with a film that takes place in a single setting but the director does an incredible job of presenting the different characters and brings a lot of personality to every one The viewer begins to understand each of the jurors as the movie progresses and their reasonings for their verdict The other great thing about this filmn is that none of the facts of the case are presented in the court and all of the knowledge the viewer has about the case come from the jurors As they present their arguments we begin to learn more about what might or might not have happened At the end of the film we still don t know what actually happened which shows that the movie isn t about whether or not the man is guilty or not but the reasoning and logic that produces the final verdict given by the jurors The tension in the jury room is amazing and you find yourself siding with certain jurors almost as if you were actually in the room',\n",

       "   'review': 'This is a pretty good example of why execution will always matter more than any kind of extravagant production or over inflated budget Anyone even remotely familiar with this film understands that it s just 12 guys in a room arguing over a trial It s a concept so simple on a visual level that it could just as easily be a middle school stage production and you could probably still find much of the iconography which comprises the setting Again though none of that takes away from this film To begin with this film couldn t have been shot better Sidney Lumet s background in television allows him to take full advantage of shifting lenses and ensemble shots which give the film an escalating sense of tension that in indispensable in convincing the audience that the dialogue happening between these men is A taking them a long time and B is physically mentally and emotionally taxing for them It s pretty easy to imagine a more amateur director shooting this film in a more flat and repetitive way Thankfully Lumet isn t an amateur Every shot and cut is so purposeful in this film Not a frame is wasted and the one room setting at no point becomes tiresome This film really reaches it s greatest heights with it s characters despite how wonderful the visual narrative is All 12 men are unique characters None of them fades in to the background and they all bring a unique perspective to the case in question You get a really good sense of the lives they lead outside the confines of this room they re in At a certain point you get to have such a good understanding of the different men that whenever a knew point of debate is brought up you can start to piece together how each one of them is going to process it and how it might affect their ultimate decision on the case It s really a bit of a difficult balancing act In the end there are certain members of the jury which naturally have to take a more dominant role in the story than the others but at the same time you have to allot the others time to bring depth to their character Lumet and the actors put it all together flawlessly One you thing you might notice when watching this film is the general lack of music I think ultimately it s better that way In all likelihood music would have been more of a distraction than a tool in enhancing the tone of a given scene There is music of course but the reservation with which it is used ends up giving it more relevance to the story than if it book ended every scene in the film This film is in the dialogue and character interaction and really there isn t enough room for any kind of over the top score but again that doesn t detract from the experience in any way Check it out if you haven t It s great 9 10',\n",

       "   'review': 'This stagebound potboiler has a plot which is a matter of shooting fish in a barrel Racism to use the prime example is used as an instance of a rush to judgment and then it s used to excuse a rush to the opposite judgment Still it s important to realize that this is entertainment The equivalent of advocacy journalism I admit but no one denies that the creators of this entertainment have agendas To the extent that the film affected me it emphasized again in my mind how fallible our system of justice is One should steer clear of it at all costs The justice system not the film And having said that we ve arrived at our system of justice through centuries of trial and error And the advocacy system still seems superior to any previous arrangement But back to the film it s respected because it s tightly plotted and exhibits impressive characterizations on the parts of several actors I m sorry that several characters are stereotypes when stereotyping itself is the crime the jury as opposed to the accused is so guilty of But the fact is that stereotyping is how messages are conveyed through the mass media and it s a matter of whose stereotypes are being retailed Rose Lumet have their own and they indeed add up to shooting fish in a barrel Immigrants good Nativist Americans bad etc There s also an implication that with enough consideration no one would ever be considered guilty of anything especially if we consider extenuating circumstances Separately it s scary to consider that the lack of air conditioning in jury rooms led to a lot of hasty verdicts Finally though I can readily imagine how bracing this entertainment was in 1957 It was probably very much like a lightning bolt',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound and as bare boned as it is a showcase of true camera work and directional complexity It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes the film moves forward quicker than real time and examines the quirks insecurities prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life as though the defendant an 18 year old street kid has already been proved guilty In general nobody in the film expects the potential and probable difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally It is an open and shut case as the remarkable unnamed juror played by Lee J Cobb states in the first ten minutes Of course it isn t otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an open and shut film Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot Over this time we see windows being opened negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men 1957 by Sidney Lumet Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed then the verdict will be guilty But if there is any room for what the judge calls reasonable doubt then the verdict changes Each character in this film is entirely different It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold Each man represents something unalike With one man s decision not to conform or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom 12 Angry Men erupts Gradually we start to understand these men first we are let it on some of their social backgrounds one is an immigrant possibly Greek or French and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways for a moment we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant s face an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto Strangely both men vote guilty without hesitation 12 Angry Men 1957 by Sidney Lumet Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing he simply does not want to decide on a person s life in the space of five minutes This is understandable the viewer takes his side and so it seems does the filmmaker But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons daughters and wives Some of the men and most noticeably Cobb as juror no 3 work themselves up into a blind fury As the film goes on it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning For some the more reasonable and likable characters it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions For others assumptions had been made as a result of deep rooted prejudices and massive complexes While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men By the end it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial as the twelve men in the film Helmed by Fonda juror no 8 the situation is played out again with incredible detail every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion This is one of the film s that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is',\n",

       "   'review': 'Perhaps few films are a credit to Television Stage and Film as well as 12 Angry Men A masterpiece of screenwriting this is and should be required viewing for all students of cinematography screenwriting and acting Many words have been written about the writing direction and acting and I doubt I can expand on any of that material other than to underscore the already glowing respect this film has earned over the years At its heart this is a peculiarly American Film While the presentation of an all White Male Jury seems dated in today s eyes it was on key when it was written in the early 1950 s urban America This is the story of social and economic poverty violence racism cultural divides and crime It is also a story of doubt fairness intellect heart and as Lincoln noted it is about the better Angels of our nature Twelve ordinary Men who normally would have little to do with each other or exist in each others orbits are required to make a judgement on the life or death of a young 18 year old man boy The fact that this is twelve middle and upper middle class White Men judging a Porto Rican Teenager is a quiet racism that is an undertone throughout this film As in many times in its history the idea of what it means to be an American and what direct is the future of America is at play here the Porto Rican boy is the future the now is an urban scene of poverty immigrants crime street gangs and violence To the men who are in this court this is just one more newspaper article and one more example of American urban life read White Male American life eroding by forces they feel are beyond their grasp and yet here is an apparent cut and dried crime they feel is understandable and something they can do something about It is a film about the wonderful part of America the part that is its true difference not its strength not is power not its culture but instead it is a film about a system of laws and governance where the ability of people to understand each other and themselves can take place and where one individual can make a difference for the good of everyone',\n",

       "   'review': 'It takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times or at the very least knows the outcome of the story Sidney Lumet s 1957 film 12 Angry Men fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet when I watched it again last night I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film The story is simple 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father who had beaten him all of his life The boy pleads not guilty but because of two eyewitnesses the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt except for one man played by Henry Fonda At first he is ridiculed for his stance until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began Because like most juries there are many differences in background social standing etc among them tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man The brilliance of 12 Angry Men can be explained in three parts First time director Sidney Lumet at the time a television director simply does everything right in this film The setting is simple most of the action takes place in the jury room with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are and the plot is pretty straightforward It is something that happens daily multiple times all across the United States But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension He makes it the hottest day of the summer and for most of the film the fan doesn t work so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts He also uses some tight close ups of the actors at times particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort Secondly the film s script is absolutely first rate Not only does the story come together like a thousand very small puzzle pieces but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other s faces for an hour and a half wouldn t be compelling but the intricacies of each juror the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic There is nothing corny in the script no placating moments where someone just suddenly sees the light every time one of the jurors changes his vote it is because there have been solid questions answers etc have been revealed In other words no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort Finally 12 Angry Men features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled Henry Fonda who usually plays a pretty good guy with a few exceptions plays a quiet hero in this film He doesn t preach he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say I don t know His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror The antithesis of Fonda s character is Lee J Cobb s juror He is a loud crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job and really managed to give their roles depth and character something that is not easy when you re sharing screen time with 11 other great actors There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film 12 Angry Men a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list I believe it was 20 the last time I looked which is extremely encouraging to me When the movie going public is rating films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy over films like Seven Samurai and Citizen Kane it is great to see that a small movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition 12 Angry Men definitely holds a place on my short list of Films I Think Everyone Should See because I think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice not from a lawmakers standpoint but from the perspective of public in general 9 10 Shelly',\n",

       "   'review': 'This film s budget must have been miniscule but nevertheless it is more interesting to look at and listen to than 98 of movies out there The personalities in this film represent a microcosm of American and the attitudes contained therein There are leaders skeptics ignorant ones and those who care about justice and the American way This film is a celebration of the American justice system This is a film where the story is capture by great dialogue and great monlogues The shots that capture the subtle emotions and movements of the characters are magnificent No over pretentious or over melodramatic ending but a satisfying one nonetheless Here the American Justice system is put to the test and the patience of 12 angry men is put on trial on one of the hottest days of the year',\n",

       "   'review': 'This film essentially begins with a jury being sequestered in a room in order to render a verdict on an 18 year old defendant charged with premeditated murder To that effect since a guilty verdict would result in the death penalty a unanimous decision is required That being said it stands to reason that each of the jurors would want to make sure that their verdict was the right one However because the evidence strongly suggests his guilt some jurors become highly indignant when one particular person known only as Juror 8 Henry Fonda expresses doubts and it s then that some people show their true colors Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is probably one of the best legal dramas that has ever been produced due in large part to the gripping plot and the number of outstanding actors also cast with Lee J Cobb as Juror 3 and E G Marshall Juror 4 standing out the most in my opinion Be that as it may I enjoyed this film and I recommend it to those viewers who are looking for a legal drama of this sort',\n",

       "   'review': 'As a non American myself it s a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works Don t get me wrong but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials where the decision depends largely on the lawyers ability to convince a group of jurors Here the decision depends more on the judge or on a collective of judges Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law but must meet a tight set of prerequisites which turns out to be a very unusual option So to understand this movie better I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass Throughout the film it is quite clear that the trial did not go well mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused something difficult to admit especially in a case of capital punishment Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence I confess I don t know I leave this to the jurists lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject The film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment quite confined and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue Dialogues are an essential part of the film and they are not always nice It is noted that there is an increase in tensions and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving this changes little by little as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase It is a frankly well written well directed film Sidney Lumet s best and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role giving us one of the best works of his career Also Lee J Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts in a deeply caustic character Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job and they all did On a technical level it is an extremely discreet film largely due to the low budget it was limited to However it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job The setting is very believable but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort Sometimes the camera gets so close to the actors faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves',\n",

       "   'review': '12 Angry Men is just brilliant It is a classic of course but time goes by and many of us young people pass on smart movies like that and that s a shame But fortunately I am here to talk about it 12 Angry Men came out in 1957 it was made by Sydney Lumet and stars Henry Fonda to name only one of the fantastic actors that made this movie so real 99 of the action takes place in the Jury room 12 Jurors are debating on a murder trial A men played by Henry Fonda will try to convince his fellow juror of the innocence of the boy accused in this trial 12 Angry Men is such a smart movie and evoke so many different themes through this one trial It mainly shows how powerful is one man s speech All of the beliefs about the case the ones that seemed so obvious to the 11 other men are refuting one after the other by the character of Henry Fonda leading to heavy doubts in the jurors mind The life of a boy depends on how will this man try to convince 11 others of what he truly believes is the truth or at least the not certainty of it Through the movie you feel the pain the claustrophobia of being in this room you just feel like you are the 13th member of the Jury All in all of course it s an old movie it s in black white but please don t pass on this movie it has a strong message and is the typical type of movie precise smart deep relevant that are strongly missing these days',\n",

       "   'review': 'I was on a desperate search for classics and my friend gave me this film and he told me a movie can t be classier I was really fascinated by this simple film The movie deals with the varying viewpoints of 12 jurors on a murder case Only one juror feels that the accused is not guilty and he goes against the other 11 with a handful of evidences against their theories Believe it or not 90 percent of the film is shot in a single room You won t find elaborate sets skimpily clad girls or any high octane action but what you are going to find is the stellar performance from all the 12 angry men and a very subtle yet edge of the seat thriller It once again proves the point that the success of any film relies on the performance of the actors and more importantly a furnished screenplay There is never any dull moment in the entire movie If you miss this movie you have missed one of the best films ever made period',\n",

       "   'review': 'A fictional story story about jury nullification and confirmation bias It s an example of the refusal of a jury to find a defendant guilty even when the facts establish guilt because that conviction would be contrary to some other concept of justice The defendant stabbed his father during an argument There s physical evidence and testimony Yet the jury plays amateur CSI and weaves ridiculous stories about their own lives to justify an acquittal This movie shows you the flaws of a jury system and how one bully on a jury panel can dominate an outcome arguing what if s and making up scenarios',\n",

       " 'wikipedia': {'plot': 'In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an impoverished 18-year-old accused of stabbing his abusive father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty; if found guilty, the defendant will receive a mandatory death sentence via the electric chair. The verdict must be unanimous.\\nAt first, the case seems clear. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father, from her window, through the windows of a passing elevated train. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father, and the father\\'s body hitting the floor; then, as he ran to his door, he saw the defendant running down the stairs. The boy has a violent past; he had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type that was found, wiped of fingerprints, at the murder scene, but claimed he lost it.\\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He says he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists. With his first few arguments seemingly failing to convince any of the other jurors, Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote; he respects Juror 8\\'s motives, and agrees that there should be more discussion.\\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of the passing train would have obscured everything the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness\\'s story. After looking at a diagram of the witness\\'s apartment and conducting an experiment, the jurors determine that it is impossible the disabled witness could have made it to the door in time. Juror 3, infuriated, argues with and tries to attack Juror 8. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.\\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant\\'s alibi based on the boy\\'s inability to recall specific details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4\\'s own memory to make a point. Jurors 2 and 5 point out the unlikelihood the boy made a stab wound angled downwards, as he was shorter than his father. Juror 7 changes his vote out of impatience rather than conviction, angering Juror 11. After another vote, Jurors 12 and 1 also change sides, leaving only three \"guilty\" votes.\\nJuror 10 goes on a bigoted rant, causing Juror 4 to forbid him to speak for the remainder of the deliberation. When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintains a guilty vote, he declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts to a guilty vote.\\nAfter watching Juror 4 remove his glasses and rub the impressions they made on his nose, Juror 9 realizes that the first witness was constantly rubbing similar impressions on her own nose, indicating that she also was a habitual glasses wearer. He observes she also always dressed up in clothes befitting a younger woman, hence not wearing the glasses in court. Juror 8 remarks that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing, would not have had glasses on or the time to put them on, making her story questionable. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 all change their vote, leaving Juror 3 as the sole dissenter.\\nJuror 3 vehemently and desperately tries to convince the others, until he finally reveals that his strained relationship with his own son makes him wish the defendant guilty. He breaks down in tears and changes his vote to \"not guilty\". As the others leave, Juror 8 graciously helps Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is acquitted off-screen, and the jurors leave the courthouse. Jurors 8 and 9 stop to learn each other\\'s real names (Davis and McCardle, respectively), before parting.'},\n",

movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch ability factor will be very high The film was incredibly entertaining too I can t think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film

\"Meritocracy: it's metaphorical\", 'comment': 'In a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination Anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky Cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous It s easy to be nice when you re rich the mother in this film Jang Hye jin at one point observes But it s a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes they ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down either by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder But in a meritocracy you can t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it No you must blame yourself You should have tread more carefully You should have climbed more quickly You should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap If you fail in a meritocracy it s all your fault You should have tried harder Better luck next time Kim Ki woo Choi Woo sik the young man who is the main character of PARASITE several times refers to metaphors and the film itself is of course a metaphor On a surface level viewers are treated to a very thrilling engaging well paced and well plotted crime story At all times however bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film there are deeply personal meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer These insights are rarely foregrounded They are so subtly interwoven in fact that if you re like me you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate humanist story you ve just witnessed Bong Joon ho s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he s done so I want to avoid spoilers here but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece beautifully lensed enthrallingly edited superbly acted and intimately involving South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky Higher education is widespread so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs I lived in Korea once and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day six days a week public school English immersion private school piano class soccer team taekwondo math camp chess club and so on I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long As the father Song Kang ho in the film at one point says this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job One can t afford not to struggle The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea however They are the story of global capitalism and the specter of American materialism and imperialism note the Indians looms heavily over the film Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all It s nice to dream and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine and how nice an ending it is when they do But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be maybe just whims and fancy More often it seems our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage',

with an intelligent social aspect to it', 'comment': 'A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family if they can engineer it they can each get one of the jobs within the household This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story seeing the rich family as the marks As it plays out though it keeps this assumption in the background eating at the viewer as an idea before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot Between the start and then the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself In this the film engages and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film for me the key one was the falseness of the con itself Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family it is not like they are stealing money from them or somehow dislodging them from their position in life no they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job and the rich family could probably not care less about the truth as long as their needs continue to be met This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film and adds sense to what happens and why but it is interesting in and of itself Technically the film looks great and the director builds mood and tone well Performances are strong across all the cast but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition but it is a handsome clever film and the timing in the year is right I don t see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture but this is more to do with the system than with the film Regardless of awards or not it is an engaging drama with unusual developments and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which

contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the America with a few cruel but precise strokes The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie', 'rating':

as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper class family and their lavish household As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on

any strict genre classification the film is a conglomeration of comedy drama satire crime horror and anything else you can throw into the mix Bong sees the film as a statement about the ranks and classes inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye and says that the film depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today s increasingly polarized society Unfortunately the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong s statement without much impact The film looks at class differences between two families one well to do and the other n eer do well For the Kim family life is a struggle They live in a cramped bug infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf The father Ki taek Song Kang ho Snowpiercer has failed in business and has accumulated many debts His son and daughter Ki woo Choi Woo sik Train to Busan and Ki jung Park So dam Cinderella and Four Knights TV series have repeatedly failed college entrance exams The mother Chung sook Hyae jin Jang Adulthood along with the two children fold boxes for a

private tutor for Da hye Of course he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs Park of his competence With that conquest out of the way the cunning Ki woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso Mrs Park hires Ki jung as an art teacher then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims this time for the deadbeat dad Ki taek and his wife Chung sook Bong said that Sometimes with the characters in my films I look at them cynically but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters even with the villains This compassion however does not seem to extend to the loyal hardworking household workers their work scammed out of existence Without going into detail the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over the top unsettling even though utterly implausible Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers revenge bloody violence a torrential rainstorm people hiding under beds and any other mayhem that may come to mind To be clear Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp edged yet it is hardly as one critic described it a masterful dissection of social inequality When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film Bong said I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about It is in parts funny frightening and sad and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a

DIRECTOR Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS Bong Joon Ho Han Jin Wan CAST Song Kang Ho Lee Sun Kyun Cho Yeo Jeong Choi Woo Shik Park So Dam Lee Jung Eun Chang Hyae Jin In the movie we follow the Kim family who doesn t have much money By chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family He teaches their daughter English Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house Then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie The title of the movie turns things on its head Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience Parasites are found in all classes of society From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and it s pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like they re on board the Titanic They must run from the top and down to the engine room What a wonderful sequence and it s so beautiful to watch The cast was fantastic and everyone fit the needs of their roles The characters were well written with the performances complementing that perfectly It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people whom despite their eccentricities maintained a grounded realistic feel The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing So if you like foreign films thrillers or movies that can make you think a little check this one out It s a crisp film from a technical aspect and with a blend of great writing and acting you can t go wrong It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence 9 10', 'rating': 9, 'link':

in my life My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space Korean films are a rarity for me This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them That is essentially what happened but you re not holding anyone s attention with that concept alone Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either Some how Parasite did that The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead The Park family was wealthy yet unlike your average rich movie family they were not cruel or unbearable people In fact they were very likeable Normally we want our clear cut good guys and bad guys We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose In the cases where all of our guys are good we want them all to win In the cases where all our guys are bad we want them all to lose In Parasite not everyone is distinctly good or

reason as well Don t get me wrong Parasites is not a bloody drama but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art it is a tragicomedy about love life and death it is a film about the joy of living about survival about the family of the 21st century but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many that sick stifled definition confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019 many dispossessed and a few privileged in a game of services and currency exchanges in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence horror and death Although director Bong Joon ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes I only know one of his films the cult fable The Guest a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus Again in Parasite Bong addresses the family issue opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children to a rich family with the same number of members The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story A third component personified by a housekeeper gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax which is not the end of the fascinating story at this point of the story it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell until the sad final close up that ends this

Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can t even move It s that spellbinding The film can t be easily put into one genre and that s true Still whether you like black comedies dramas thrillers or not you must see this film at least once It s just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming you can t forget any of that for a long time Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time Words won t be sufficient to further describe this film s actual brilliance I m still spellbound What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended It took away the very feel of watching a film Whatever I saw just felt real absolutely real No doubt Parasite is one of the most original films you ll see in the

whole bunch of films that I could say now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen Since 2017 the most that I could say about I film I love would have been I love this film But I don t adore it One of the best of the year not ever Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours But throughout that duration time stands still We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains Parasite follows two families the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum many people interpret this as a social satirical film I can see where they are coming from but I didn t care about that Many different themes such as identity are also looked at but that is all just icing on the cake Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions so we root for them right away to get out of the slums Ki woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da hye in english Ki woo does not know English well but figures he can fake it and make some money he may be just a tutor but it pays well He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son so Ki woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy s therapist With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job it all seems like a sinch to get them in But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom Parasite could be simplified as family vs family but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters They are smart sympathetic even likeable The reason I call this film Hitchcockian is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine Even when a movie is unpredictable the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily But with this each time a twist comes which is frequent the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard The director really pulls out the rug from underneath Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director Bong Joon Ho could easily have messed up at any moment But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material In fact it it just the opposite the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate With all that happens Parasite becomes an imservie film

as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety second Academy Awards This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy drama horror thriller and tragedy The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money Parasite however is less cumbersome melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit depth and creativity instead International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions The movie is so detailed precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again I m grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre People are craving for a change and are tired of tame predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels remakes and sequels There should be more creative dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in

of society since the dawn of time is that of class From the days of cavemen the Roman Empire the Enlightment and even modern times philosophers scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor It s something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all It s hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that s its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa This is also something that many movies has dived into In fact one of my favorite movies of the 2000 s is the science fiction thriller Snowpiercer It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out It s a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into It looks like he s made another movie about class except Parasite is a smaller story about two families but is still as impactful We start with a family of four living in the slums in a basement under a store father Kim Ki Taek played by Song Kang ho mother Chung sook played by Jang Hye jin son Kim Ki woo played by Choi Woo shik and daughter Kim Ki Jeong played by Park So dam They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes When a friend of the son comes to visit he offers Kim Ki woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family s daughter He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of a fancy house built by a famous architect wide space a backyard and nice cars After some convincing from the family a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son the father as a new driver errand runner and the mother as the new housekeeper The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something Though there is a second half to the movie I can t talk about it without spoiling it Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019 It may sound like a typical dark comedy but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn t expect At the front this is still a story on class difference A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of helping the poor Thankfully Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different Parasite doesn t try to make the wealthy family out to be villains But they don t try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child If anything it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad but even that can depend on a number of factors This movie is the prime example of would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully but it s acted amazingly Though the movie is in Korean you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I ve seen this year hence why I m not naming them one by one I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has I ll give this ten fancy houses out of ten It may be in a different language but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year This is the kind of movie that can be hard

surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society As the name of the film itself the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house only to get the shock of their life Directed by Bong Joon Ho who made Snowpiercer and Okja Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to A poverty driven family comprising of a struggling father Kim and mother tech savvy son and a careless sister who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich by falsely accusing the old staffs The main drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim s family take over the house and celebrate their win However they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the old staff comes back which changes their plan completely This is where the film kicks off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads to series of uninvited events leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected If you go the wrong way you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim s loses one of his family member and ultimately face the redemption Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly when two staff families meet at the basement the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim s family Kim picking up in stuff son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess The beauty of cinema lies in the story telling and this is where Parasite scores Technically Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography Editing is superb though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed Art direction is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding Performances wise I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up my favourite would be Kang ho

original stories and supply timely commentary in the process We meet the impoverished Kim family father Ki taek Song Kang ho mother Chung sook Jang Hye jin son Ki woo Choi Woo shik and daughter Ki

song evolve Through a series of events I won t spoil Veronica later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki taek going by Mr Kim who in turn recommends a new housekeeper played by Chung sook The way the Kims continually fool the Parks from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad libbing based on research they ve done for the fields they pretend to work in is clever tense impossible to predict and morbidly hilarious throughout It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it s edited for instance cutting from Ki taek lying to Yeon gyo to him finishing the same sentence during Ki woo s rehearsals how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence and how utterly believable these performances are The actors who portray the Kims in particular give remarkably layered performances Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family s home employees The characters themselves are convincing actors hence their successful duping of the Parks which makes each real world actor s performance all the more considerable And yes it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position but the film is self aware and deliberate about this not only because the Parks in their carefree luxury aren t the most observant This is all comical to experience yes but what Bong has to say about class inequity and during the film s bleaker later scenes how it isn t necessarily so simple as letting the poor have some luxury for the sake of fairness is what makes Parasite stick We may understand the downtrodden Kims we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique and laugh at their conniving schemes but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end Parasite is generally well loved but divisive in the circles you d expect My guilty pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families also calling it a cancel culture comedy because I guess anti family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to cancel offensive celebrities and indeed berate classism So far as I can decipher White s main evidence is the fact that in the story a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi titular social parasites whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists As mentioned the Kims aren t strictly heroes or justified Isn t this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has

conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family The two screenplay writers one of them was the director Bong simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99 struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1 rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation like feel good opportunity for the poor a self righteous self justified self indulgent revenge on the rich class At the beginning of this movie this lowlife 4 member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition the husband father was unemployed for a very long time the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times This helpless and hopeless family couldn t simply become a well practiced con artist family overnight If they were such great scammers they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time They were just like you and me who don t have money to afford a dignified basic living standard They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con artist so easy and so soon The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers director who made the rich people looked so stupid naive emotional fragile and so easily to be conned they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich The differences between the rich and the poor are many but usually it s because the rich people are smarter more intelligent more cunning 1 000 times sharper than the poor they are not so easy to be manipulated conned scammed or swindled otherwise they wouldn t become rich and successful Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn t even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile naive shallow emotional wreck but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split hair sharp otherwise they d not be able to handle their social status The husband in this movie also showed that he s a hardworking super smart self made businessman and entrepreneur he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers Yet this movie again simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers In summary Zero Probability Highly Unlikely The long term helpless 4 member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well experienced well organized smart grifters swindlers How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly so suddenly become so smart so organized so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step It s against the basic logic and absolute impossible The director screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples hate resent bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10 minutes standing ovation it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich so they were so generous to award this one way street movie the grand prize I don t know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con artist imposter swindler fraud genre movies Ah ga ssi Handmaiden 2016 is almost the same like this sucker but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love making scenes these two movies are basically the same HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE SAME CRAP DIFFERENT TITLE Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them To me both of these two movies are just a torture to watch There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers so I think it s time to call off making such stupid movies I m a poor guy yet I don t hate the rich people but envy them I m also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me there s no way I could manipulate

today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer director Bong Joon Ho Parasite has already received numerous accolades with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director and Best International Feature Film making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition At the 77th Golden Globe Awards the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards It also became the first non English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture The film s title Parasite was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning which he had to convince the film s marketing group to use Bong said Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family and I think that s why the marketing team was a little hesitant But if you look at it the other way you can say that rich family they re also parasites in terms of labor They can t even wash dishes they can t drive themselves so they leech off the poor family s labor So both are parasites I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I m sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout Stairs are used as a motif voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times and most obviously there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park s home I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film Unfortunately I ve only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon It s a movie I want to watch again as it s as good as all the hype it s getting and what a journey it takes the audience on Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2 2 20 this film had grossed a Worldwide 163 3 million and was estimated to have cost 11 million to produce Of course I don t know any of the actors but they re all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year I still think it s odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I m certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to I m still so fond of Pedro Almod var s Pain Glory Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more There s so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite The story depicts Class divides Climate Catastrophes Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it s unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing Emma this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series Succession portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup The common thread that Parasite Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it s survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently dresses differently or anyone doesn t process a degree or wealth The poor family s ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular neurotic self obsessed rich Park family 2 comments from Parasite said by Ki taek and wife Chung sook stay in my mind Ki taek They are rich but still nice Chung sook Ki taek s wife They are nice because they are rich Chung sook Ki taek s wife If I had all this I would be kinder Ki taek Rich people are naive No resentments No creases on them Chung sook Ki taek s wife It all gets ironed out Money is an iron Those creases all get smoothed out by money Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites parasite Learn to pronounce noun 1 an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species its host and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other s expense', 'rating': 9, 'link': 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456337/?ref_=tt_urv'}}, {'MovieName': 'Parasite_2019',

for the first time with subtitles For a foreign film from Korea this is very accessible for all languages and audiences The actors are all expressive attractive and do a really good job acting The story has lots of universal contemporary components to it of pop culture For what it s worth the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea s City of God or something along those lines what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed well written and pretty gritty It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller part mystery without giving away spoilers I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating but unfortunately I just could not Sorry but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded and that s not to say that it wasn t fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the perfect range of storytelling The same issue also arose in the second back half of the movie some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10 However other than these two fairly big big enough to deduct two points flaws the script is practically perfect especially for a foreign film The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate immerse and challenge your mind while also keeping it entertaining They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender but unfortunately it just didn t quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility It could still happen but after viewing it with an open mind it looks like it s between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917 EDIT Slept on it and decided I would

an episode of Grand Designs would die for It s not until half an hour in that this new hope gives way a little Just a little crack almost undetectable What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit I m loathed to give too many details but suffice to say this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace it s nothing short of perfect I don t

nitpick The film s message is a little on the nose but I don t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable Other than that this film is perfect There is not one bad performance in the movie Cho Yeo jeong Park So dam and Kang Ho Song are standouts from the film All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable Another aspect I loved was the cinematography The film s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design The film s story and themes make this film incredible The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems It s so incredibly tense You never know what is going to happen next and it s always surprising to see what eventually happens The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family Every time this occurs you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil His score adds so much more to the tension I know I m using the word tension a lot but that s what this film is A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale For me each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year Overall Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting great cinematography and a powerful story about class divide even

surprise 2019 hit Parasite that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars Incomparable to any other film you could think of Parasite is a very original beast that believe it or not combines drama comedy thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre understanding as possible Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot line that may seemingly be headed one way only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected Wonderfully played out by its core cast with highlights from Kang ho Song as father Ki taek and Hye jin Jang as mother Chung sook Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you re glued to the screen unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho As you watch the expertly directed edited and scored film one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next you begin to appreciate that you re watching a director operating at the top of their game in what s still likely a career only around its halfway mark it s exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations remakes or sequels its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new fresh and exhilarating no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema goers helped make Parasite a world wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars Final Say While not flawless Parasite isn t far off it a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and

two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years I thought both of those films were great so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film Parasite After viewing not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019 but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you ll see all year Now some people may not like the turn it takes but here s why I think Parasite demands to be seen To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven t seen it so I ll stick to the basics here The Kim family lives in a basement living space All unemployed they find any way they can to make things work Ki woo the eldest sibling in the family is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con artists Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate this makes for some terrific tension The biggest praise I can give this film is that it s constantly in motion never wasting a moment to surprise you The set up for this movie has many clever aspects to it the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn t disappoint either Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to it becomes that much more interesting In other hands this story could ve have come off as a very generic film but there s truly something special about how well made Parasite is Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say It s very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon This movie is brilliantly made in every way It s very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here so I won t bother trying because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much A great engaging story that surprises you from start to finish along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year I can t praise this film enough

the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone Parasite is nothing short of genius It s best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent Bong Joon Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety Bong Joon Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience The events that unfold don t come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing Aside from the story this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019 The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic The editing is fantastic as the film s pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever The aesthetics on the whole is top notch I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense Whilst delivering a fun film there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they re dumb 2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven t then go watch it immediately This is a film you should not miss', 'rating': 10, 'link':

year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews It s an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the past ten years I won t say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible extremely wealthy family The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society but also in the world as a whole From there its main raison d tre expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations The results are shocking startling hilarious and utterly brilliant Such results certainly couldn t be achieved without a truly outstanding cast but lucky for us Bong Joon ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble Even more impressive is the film s character development While the film s primary characters are often not the most ethical they are surprisingly likable and multi dimensional especially when heightened by both emotion and tone You ll certainly remember them long after the credits roll But what s most unforgettable about Parasite is that the film manipulates in the best way possible its tone in so many unique and engaging ways that it is able to fully subvert the viewer s expectations of not only how the film will go but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions Combining laugh out loud witty comedy taut suspense and moments of pitch black darkness viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years While such tonal shifts may sound erratic they could not have been done more perfectly here so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film s almost impeccable tightness not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged One review cited in the film s trailer calls Parasite a magic trick I

And this one did just that Packed with terrific direction commendable performances from the whole cast the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category It made me think it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it I just couldn t express the feelings I got watching this In one word it s truly a masterpiece It Won 4 academy awards this year and that s not a mean feat Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics the industry people and us the audience This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about It s entertaining thrilling with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind I assure you this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the Parasite in here The class difference the economical boundaries set by the same people It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects And it can be applicable to any country though it s been made having Korean culture and society in mind this story would be relatable to everyone No matter the country Someone lives in But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention Every character and their actions represent something And you need to find that connection And don t worry you will as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo trailer and articles before watching it Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally Enough of the review now I just wanna say go and watch this film immediately It s amazing and a surreal

in giving you the cerebral food\", 'comment': 'Parasite is a deep complex layered multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven ts the haven ts are pitted against each other It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax Director Bong Joon Ho of Memories of Murder and The Host fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human s imperialistic pleasures As a result what starts in a mild satirical tone climaxes in a disturbing manner so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle This is no easy movie let me remind you But if you can finish the journey it can stay with you forever for the ample food for thought it offers Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre', 'rating': 9, 'link': 'https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470227/?ref_=tt_urv'}},

ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there', 'rating': 10, 'link':

quite matches it It s funny it s heartbreaking it s intense It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused which is something that many films fail to do The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic with no good guys or bad guys They re people They feel like real and believable characters which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year It s well shot as to be expected and the social commentary is fantastic This is the first movie I ve seen in the longest time that I can describe as

Min-hyuk, a university student, gives the family a scholar\\'s rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims\\' son, Ki-woo, pose as a university student to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is subsequently hired by the Park family.\\nThe Kim family schemes to get each member a job with the Park family. Ki-woo recommends \"Jessica\", actually his sister Ki-jung, as an art therapist for the Parks\\' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a \"ghost\" in their kitchen. Ki-jung frames Yoon, Mr Park\\'s chauffeur, by making it appear he had a sexual encounter in the car, then recommends her relatives\\' chauffeur, in actuality her father, Ki-taek, to take his place. The Kims exploit the peach allergy of the Parks\\' long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that she has tuberculosis, and the Kim matriarch, Chung-sook, is hired as her replacement. Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye.\\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the house. Moon-gwang appears at the door, telling Chung-sook she left something in the basement. She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the architect and previous homeowner (who was too embarrassed to inform the Park family of its existence). There, Moon-gwang\\'s husband Geun-sae is revealed to be living in the bunker while hiding from loan sharks; he is also revealed to be the \"ghost\", whom Da-song saw attempting to come out of the bunker to steal groceries from the Parks\\' refrigerator. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang\\'s pleas to allow Geun-sae remain in the bunker in exchange for regular payments, but the three other eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal themselves to be related. Moon-gwang videotapes them on her phone inadvertently revealing their deception and threatens to expose them to the Park family.\\nThe Parks call to say that they are returning early due to a severe rainstorm. The Kims subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae, tying them up and hiding them in the bunker.  Ki-jung, Ki-taek and Ki-woo hide under a table, and overhear Mr Park\\'s comments about Ki-taek\\'s odour, one he associates with lower-class people. The Kims eventually escape, but the torrential rain floods their flat with sewer water, forcing them to take shelter in a gymnasium with other, similarly displaced people.\\nThe next day, Mrs Park hosts a house party for Da-song\\'s birthday with the elder Kims\\' assistance; the younger Kims are invited as guests. Ki-woo enters the bunker with his scholar\\'s rock to kill Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. Moon-gwang is already dead from a concussion she received during yesterday\\'s brawl, but Ki-woo is attacked by Geun-sae, who uses the rock to knock Ki-woo out, leaving him lying in a pool of blood in the basement. Geun-sae then stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae again. Geun-sae and Chung-sook grapple with each other; she fatally impales him with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders Ki-taek to drive Da-song to the hospital.
